Again though, the extent this is implemented in the Afrikaner-dominant states is kept at the required minimum. Despite this, qualified franchise in the other states ensures that non whites of at least 'middle class' wealth and education are eligible. This is most prominant in the Cape, where the qualified franchise is the most inclusive and full adult suffrage is granted to the Coloured & Asiatic populations. The same is true in Natal for the Asiatics, with the second largest franchise in South Africa.

The Senate is the first upper house, its members representing their states as a whole, the number of representatives each state is allocated is determined via their total electorate number, meaning that states with a larger electorate wield more power in the Senate as legislation is required to pass all three of the houses. This is set to seriously disavantage the Afrikaner states, who, by keeping their franchise limited preserve their rights in-state while ceding influence on the Federation as a whole. The second upper house, the House of Lords, is a advisory council composed of hereditary native rulers. They have a limited veto unlike the Senate in a manner modeled on the old United Kingdom's                           # Parliament, although they do have the right to legislate on matters that solely relate to the governance of the Native Trust land and have considerable influence in this area.
