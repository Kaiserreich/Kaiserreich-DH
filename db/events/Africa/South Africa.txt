The British Revolution gave the anti-British coalition of the National and Labour Parties the opportunity to break free from British influence that they had been under since the end of the 2nd Boer War (1899-1902). The first President of South Africa, James Hertzog, used the chaos to annex the neighbouring British protectorates of South Rhodesia, Bechuanaland, Basotuland and Swaziland while leaving the remainder of Britain's African colonies to fall into the hands of the German Freistaat.

While the vast majority of the population belong to the various native ethnic African groups, socio-economic power is held by the white European minority. This in turn is divided between the Afrikaners - Dutch speaking descendants of the original Dutch colonists and the Boers who settled the Transvall and Orange Free State - and the British, who form the majority of the white population in Natal and Rhodesia. The Cape province is a melting pot of both Afrikaner and British, as well as being home to the majority of South Africa's Coloreds (people of mixed white and black ancestry). The country also houses a noticeable Indian prescience, a legacy of the Empire. Considerable legislation exists limiting the rights of the non-white population - such as land ownership, required passports for internal movement within South Africa, segregation of urban districts etc.

desc = EVT_17002_DESC # South Africa's current constitution is an adaption of the 1909 South Africa Act. The Union of South Africa is a unitary state, rather than a federation, with each colony's parliaments abolished and replaced with provincial councils. The Parliament consists of two parts, the Volksraad and Senate. The Volksraad members are elected mostly by the country's white minority although the franchise varies depending upon the province, of which there are five - Cape, Natal, the Orange Free State, Transvaal and Rhodesia. In the Cape and Natal, a qualified franchise based upon property and education requirements is in place while the vote is white only in the remaining provinces. The Senate is appointed by an electoral college consisting of members of each of the five Provincial Councils and members of the Volksraad. Government follows the Westminster model, although with an elected President as head of state. South Africa continues to administer Bechuanaland, Basotuland and Swaziland as protectorates                       # and while considerable legislation is in place restricting the rights of the native population within the Union, it has not been fully implemented in these territories.

Many of these laws have been preventing Statthalter Göring from exploiting the native labour force. The Reichskolonialamt might now be finally led by administrator more friendly to Göring. By cutting social security, and reinstating forced labour, they will be able to cheaply exploit many new sources of income.

Such a move would draw the ire of the other sections os South African society and is something we are perhaps not ready for just yet.

# Economic Recovery Plans

# Next up I think are the various recovery plans by the respective governments prior to the 1938 election. These break down something like this:
# . (Non-Split) National Party - A moderate recovery program and a social program that promotes the Afrikaan/Dutch heritage.
# . NP/Labour Coalition - A moderate recovery program and a social program that promotes increased rights for the white South African worker
# . NP/Dominion United Coalition - A moderate recovery program and a social program that seeks to balance the various racial tensions in the
#   country without favouring one side too much (Afrikaner/British/Native). In addition the Dominionists will be trying to push for a reopening of
#   contact with the Empire/Entente.

# Native Labor In The Union of South Africa
#
# This comes about via pressure from the Freistaat dissolving their restrictions on forced labor by the natives, and using this new pool of
# workers to industrialise the Freistaat. Mines, Dams, etc. all at severe cost to the African population. Now Goring is already perceived as a
# threat by all the factions of South Africa - their one asset is their level of industrialization. If this is lost to the Freistaat, who have
# manpower in the form of the askaris and German colonial units and material from the Kaiserreich, they will be in a dangerous position, both
# economically and militarily. Should this arise, the Union of South Africa will get the option to try and match the growth of the Freistaat
# in excess of their own economic recovery by restricting the labor rights of native workers in South Africa as well.
#
# Now, this will be expensive, in both money, material and dissent. It will anger the Progressives, the ANC and the ISL (and affiliates). But
# the growth in resource extraction, IC and Infrastructure, if managed properly might be worth it. This will of course be yet another step on
# the road to Apartheid, one that could be repealed by the S.A.F. to the detriment of further progress.
#
# 3 Options:
#	1. Reject the idea
#	2. Ease restrictions (IE% Boost + dissent)
#	3. Large scal repeal of workers rights for natives (IE% Boost, Dissent, a unique event for forced labor in the Nuweveld and an event
#	   chain for a construction projet. Dams, Mines, new factories.

# Native Autonomy in the Union of South Africa
#
# This begins as a clarification for the Union govt. Are the new Paramount Chiefs of the High Commission Territories the rulers of just the
# former protectorates or are they rulers of their respective ethnic groups (the Swazi or just Swaziland etc). From there, this status can be
# extended to the other major ethnic native African groups in South Africa with accompanying benefits (IE% boost, light Infrastructure bonus,
# open society sliders) and drawbacks (obviously not as much development as in the other chains, persistent -$, Afrikaner dissent).
#
# The next part is the establishment of native units - initially just for the HCT as above, but expanding depending on govt type and other factors
#
# The scale of all this depends on how far the govt is willing to go. The more power is devolved to more tribes, the more local development and
# men are made available. The Dominionists are most in favour - it lays some of the groundwork for their plans for later federalisation. Labour
# and the Nationalists are much more reserved and will likely limit themselves to local autonomy in the HCT.

This was offset however by the large turnout of Afrikaners from other parts of South Africa to take part, including a group calling themselves the Ossewabrandwag (Ox-Wagon Sentinels). Unfortunately this militia of sorts clashed with local police who struggled to handle the larger than expected turnout. With violence escalting the police tried to bring the procession and disperse the reenactors which resulted in shots being exchanged, killing 3 policemen and 17 Ossewabrandwag with many more reenactors and bystanders injured.

# The 4th Boer War
#
# There are several triggers for this conflict - the Voortrekker being just one. The others are the immediate push for Apartheid (thus triggering
# native resistance and British secession) and an immediate push for federalism (triggering an Afrikaner nationalist attempted coup and the
# resulting secession of the Boer Republics and the formation of the 2nd Z.A.R.)
#
# Note: Originally wrote this as the 3rd Boer War so apologies if that crops up - depending on viewpoint this is either the 3rd or the 4th Boer
# War, the Maritz Rebellion being the '3rd'. It comes down to perspective, and as KTL South Africa is much more Afrikaner focused, the 4th is
# ultimately the more likely of the 2.

The Immorality Amendment Act forbade 'unlawful racial intercourse' and 'any immoral or indecent act' between a white and a black, Indian or coloured person.

Under apartheid, the percentage of land reserved was increased from 8 to 13 percent to be used for black homelands, still a relatively small amount compared with the total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. These homelands or 'Bantustans' divided South Africa into a number of separate states, each of which is supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for the different ethnic groups. The practical effect of this legislation was to remove the citizenship of natives living within South Africa and reduce their status to that of migrant labour. The Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act abolished the remaining parliamentary representation for black people under the Representation of Natives Act, now represented by their own 'national' authorities.
