name = EVT_11000_NAME # Freistaat Mittelafrika
desc = EVT_11000_DESC # Ever since the end of the Weltkrieg, officials in both Berlin and Dar Es Salaam have had designs about expansion of the Freistaat Mittelafrika. Most of those plans involved the annexation of the Portuguese colonies in Africa, most notably Angola and Mozambique - true geopolitical anomalies, foreign enclaves within a mighty and huge German colonial holding. Only the Peace with Honour accords, which preserved the colonial empires of the Entente powers after the Great War, has prevented the annexation of these territories. During the 1920s and the early 1930s, Berlin officially abandoned these expansion plans and instead started to rebuild good relations with Portugal. But since the ascension of Hermann Goering as governor of Mittelafrika in 1932, everything has changed. He secretly harbours the desire to personally "correct" the existence of the Portuguese colonial empire and expand Mittelafrika, which he sees as his personal dominion. However, without some kind of pretext that would allow him to justify an expansion of Mittelafrika before Secretary of the German Colonial Office Wilhelm Solf and the Reichstag, both reluctant to spend Germany's limited resources, he will never be allowed this. For now, Goering impatiently awaits the opportunity to prove his worth before the German nation....

But a reformist faction, seeking to improve relations with the local African elites, is pushing either for Karl Atangana, the loyal paramount chief of the Ewondo people of Niger-Kamerun or for Achirimbi II, the tenth king of Bafut in Kamerun.

Now, the question of Portuguese colonies has come up again in the governnment. Should we try to convince Berlin usefulnes of territorial expansion of Mittelafrika, especially now with discovery of oil deposits in Angola or should we leave them be ?
