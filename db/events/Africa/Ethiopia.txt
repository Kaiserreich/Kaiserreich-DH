Ethiopia would also gain a lot potentially, as this marriage could serve to bring Japanese capital and expertise into our country. However, other powers would not be happy with this move - Germany, mainly, would be quite upset by seeing us drift into the Japanese sphere.

desc = EVT_2108_DESC # Ethiopia, also known as Abyssinia, was the only African state which managed to remain independent during the XIXth century Scramble for Africa, succesfully defeating an Italian invasion in 1896. This victory kickstarted the proccess of modernization in the Ethiopian Empire, in order to bring the country close to European standards regarding its economy, army and administration. In 1918, under empress Zauditu, the Ethiopian Empire entered the Weitkrieg on the side of the Germans, succesfully annexing the Italian colonies of Somaliland and Eritrea. Another sign of Ethiopia's modernization was the expansion of the DPAEB railroad, a vital transport link for the country. In 1930, Empress Zauditu died with no surviving children, which prompted her cousin Ras Tafari Makonnen to ascend the throne as Emperor Haile Selassie. The new monarch announced his intention to start a new series of reforms to bring Ethiopia 'into the west'. These initiatives, however, were fiercely opposed by the conservative nobility of the nation, who had been greatly strengthened by the annexation of the Italian colonies and the subsequent expansion of the army. Haile Selassie also faces opposition from the important Italian business community in Eritrea, who feel that any disturbance to the status quo will mean an end to their privileges. The imperial government, meanwhile, has suffered another blow in 1935, when a report by the German Ministry of Trade announced the fragile economical situation of the DPAEB, which puts the entire Ethiopian economy at risk - thus definitely proving the unefficiency of Ethiopia rallying to the German sphere. With an worldwide economical crisis approaching, Ethiopia may need to decide whether to continue its current relationship with Germany, seek new trade partners or pursue her own independent foreign policy.

The particular interpretation of Panafricanism as promoted by dr.
