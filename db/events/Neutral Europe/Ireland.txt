Tariffs were set at 20 percent to both imports and exports, as a means of hurting the nascent Irish state and as a protectionist measure to aid British business that was reeling from the loss of the Great War. The Irish responded in kind as a means of affirming their independence of Britain. The situation did not change as a result of the 1925 Revolution and establishment of the Union of Britain in a large part due to the ideological differences between the Unionists and Collins' Fine Gael. Now however, with Ireland having helped defeat the Syndicalists and restore the United Kingdom, the Trade War has come to an end and both parties are set to reap the economic benefits.
