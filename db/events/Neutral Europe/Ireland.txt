The Nationalist faction in Sinn Féin want to bring Ireland closer into Germany's sphere to better protect Ireland and have the Republic engage with Europe. There is also a vocal minority of both parties that wish to maintain an isolationist approach, while moderates in Fianna Fáil and the trade unionist left-wing of Sinn Féin want Ireland to begin a normalisation of relations with the Union of Britain. However, some suspect that William Norton, a leading figure of the left in the Dáil and proponent of rapprochement may be planning something more radical...

desc = EVT_382163_DESC # Since the signing of the first Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922 that established the Irish Free State within the British Empire there existed an economic conflict between the UK and Ireland. Tariffs were set at 20 percent to both imports and exports, as a means of hurting the nascent Irish state and as a protectionist measure to aid British business that was reeling from the loss of the Great War. The Irish responded in kind as a means of affirming their independence of Britain. The situation did not change as a result of the 1925 Revolution and establishment of the Union of Britain in a large part due to the ideological differences between the Unionists and Collins' Fine Gael. Now however, with Ireland having helped defeat the Syndicalists and restore the United Kingdom, the Trade War has come to an end and both parties are set to reap the economic benefits.
