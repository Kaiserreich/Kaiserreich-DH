On the other hand, there are many among the Church who advocate a continuation of the campaign started by Pius XI for the creation of Catholic corporations: they would be structured, organized and controlled with our support and they would actively act to support workers and enterprises, according to the principle of solidarity. Finally, the left-leaning members of the Church believe that the corporations should not be controlled by us, but that we should allow the creation of non-catholic trade unions. This would lead to the creation of many new independent unions that support the workers of our country.\n§RNOTE: the last option is available only if John XXIII is the Head of State.

Each corporation would be able to send a delegate to the Commission in each of the 8 administrative entities of the Federation (Principality of Sardegna-Piemonte, Papal State, Grand Duchy of Toscana, Duchy of Modena, Ferrara and Reggio, Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, Republic of Lombardia, Republic of Liguria, Republic of Corsica). Each administrative entity would therefore have 9 Commissions with delegates from all corporations. Each Commission would elect 10 delegates to the Council of Corporations of its own administrative entity which is therefore composed by 90 men. The Council of Corporation of each entity gathers every week for its ordinary work. Moreover, once every three months (or whenever it is necessary to take decisions or iron out differences) all Councils gather together in the National Council of Corporations (which is therefore composed by the 720 members of the 8 Councils and 72 Commissions) to take decisions at national level.
