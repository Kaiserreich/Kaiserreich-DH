### IMPORTANT FLAGS
#	END_ACW 	- THE ACW IS OVER
#			Basic flag used to prevent some events from firing
#			if ACW is still going on.
#	CSA_COLLECT 	- COLLECTIVIZATION
#			Presumably this flag was supposed to lead to a whole chain
#			of issues springing from Stalinesque collectivization of farms
#	CSA_Banks	- BANKS NATIONALIZED
#			Flag used for one other event in "Flavour Events.text"
#			otherwise not used further. Good for getting money quick, but
#			should probably have some downsides besides tiny dissent hike
#	CSA_COMM	- TOTALIST	
#			Signifies CSA is Totalist-leaning
#	CSA_ANA		- ANARCHO-SYNDICALIST	
#			Signifies CSA is Anarchist-leaning
#	CSA_TRADE	- TRADE UNIONIST	
#			Signifies CSA is Trade Unionist-leaning
#	MISSBURN 	- SOUTHERN VIOLENCE
#			If CSA goes Totalist, there's a three-part event chain detailing
#			a widespread race riot and revolt in the south, using this flag.
#			It's not very expansive and there is currently no choice in the
#			matter. I intend to work on this some.
