# 903950-903952 was formerly the "PSA puppets Mexico" Treaty chain
# This was an extremely flawed event chain that let CAL puppet MEX if at war via a special peace treaty.
# I will be removing it because it conflicts with events already well-established in the Mexico event file.
# Furthermore it was just dumb. MEX didn't even have the option to refuse whatever terms CAL suggested.
# These three event IDs will be reserved for something else.
#NOTE: This is from Mazianni, wonder what you all think? - Eberronguy
#
#
# NOTICE: 903952 is now used for the Treaty of Sacremento event because holy hell these events are out of order and I did not want to have to change the bunch of events I had just made.
