Young director Orson Welles put on a production of the infamous 'Scottish play,' Macbeth, but instead of using the traditional Scottish setting he opted to adapt the Shakespeare play to the island of Haiti, making use of an all-black cast. Theater critics have been raving about the perfomances, but it has not gone without criticism. Several African-American activists, including some tied to the Combined Syndicates of America, accused Welles before the premiere of either stunt casting or degrading the cast in a possible 'burlesque' version of the play. Far-Right individuals tied to the American Union Party have levelled similar criticisms, although accusing the play's casting as being CSA propaganda./nThat said, the production has indeed attracted praise from across the political spectrum. There are fringe theories that the titular character was intended to be an allegory for several notable figures in contemporary politics, whether it be Jack Reed, Huey Long, or rising star General Douglas MacArthur. This speculation has only served to fuel the play's popularity.
