##################
### BRAZILIAN CIVIL WAR!!!
###
### SET 1 of events are the actual Civil War setup. Each of the four possible
### governments (ANL, DEM, REP or INT) has one event in which a rival faction
### will attempt to perform a coup. The player has the option of either accepting
### the coup (cabinet is reformed, policies are changed, etc.) or fighting
### (which will trigger sets 2 and 3).
###
### SET 2 describes the reactions of the three possible REBELS (CW_REBVAR for
### Vargas, CW_REBANL for Prestes and CW_REBINT for the Integralists). So, if
### the Integralists are the rebels, they will pop up in the south-southeastern
### provinces and will crackdown on trade unions. Meanwhile, if Prestes leads
### the rebels, they will start in another set of provinces, occupy farms and
### round up reactionaries.
###
### SET 3 deals with the GOVERNMENTS and their reactions - ie., which special
### units will pop up, if some members of the military will defect...
###
### SET 4 ENDS the Civil War for each of the four governments.
###
### SET 5 Contains FOREIGN INTERVENTIONS AND REACTIONS to the BCW - For now,
### only for La Plata...
###
### The war has two simple rules:
### 1. If the government occupies all provinces, they win.
### 2. If REB occupy Rio, they win and assume the government.
