# Note 1: I feel like it is important to try and include the foci as singular events or decision groups, even if the effects are minimal in most events (555508 and 555509 for example). 
# The main reason is that it allows up to have gradual differences between the time an event fires (the actual event) and the aftermath (bypassed foci).
