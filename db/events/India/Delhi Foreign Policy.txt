The current state of the Royal Indian Marine leaves much to be desired both in regards to the vessels employed as well as the training of the few capable officers serving. However, the Empire at large has a proud naval tradition and both the Canadian and Australasian shipyards and naval colleges provide the Atlantic and Pacific theatres of operation with powerful fleets where imperial power can be projected. Consequently the naval chief of staff and admiralty in Karachi have petitioned the prime minister with pleas to secure development aid from our allies so that Indian commerce can penetrate the high seas adequately escorted.
