desc = EVT_252000_DESC	#In what has come to be called the 'Lost Decade', The 1920's were a time of economic depression and political instability for Japan. The plight was particularly severe in the agricultural sector, and caused a massive demographic change as farmers fled from the depressed countryside to urban areas, flooding the labour market and further driving down wages. After leaving the Kenseikai-led 'Constitutionalist Coalition' and taking charge of the Government, Inukai and his government successfully expanded the Japanese sphere of influence into Manchuria and the edges of Siberia, acquiring a vital export market for the Japanese economy, but the agricultural situation continued to deteriorate as cheap agricultural imports from Manchuria bled into the countryside. As 1936 dawns, continued rearmament and state investment has fully rebuilt the industrial economy, but the issue of rural poverty remains chronic and unsolved.

The Rikken Seiyukai has an absolute majority from the general election of 1932, but support in the countryside (Their traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base throughout the cities and began to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyukai's absolute majority in the Diet. A new, third player in the general election of 1936 is the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933. It is now time to see if the Seiyukai have retained enough seats to keep an absolute majority...

desc = EVT_252003_DESC	#Born in 1859, Katayama Sen was one of the most senior syndicalist leaders in Japan, known as the 'father of Japanese syndicalism'. Exiled to the USA after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed and was influenced by Jack Reed's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA. Katayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rodo-Nominto (Labour-Farmer Party), and after the party was declared illegal in 1932, he formed another party called the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), an amalgamation of social democratic parties and syndicalist movements. Yesterday, while visiting Kyoto to congratulate Taishuto member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 75, never regained consciousness and died earlier today.

desc = EVT_252004_DESC	#The shock of the assassination of Katayama Sen initially united the Shakai Taishuto in solidarity against the "white terror", but the unity did not last long. The party was originally structured as a coalition of various social democrat and syndicalist organisations, only united in the goal of 'socialisation of the economic structure with the proletariat at its foundation'. Before his death, Katayama had guided the party away from ideological clashes, but deprived of its leader the party was forced to face the question of its precise ideological position, and infighting soon began. Throughout the spring of 1936, national-syndicalists, called the Nichirokei (Japan-Labour Clique), adopted Totalism and vigorously expanded its membership, not only inside the party at expense of the moderate Shaminkei (Social Democratic Clique) but also outside the party, notably within the Shaminkei-controlled Nihon Rodo Sodomei (Japan General Federation of Labour). Soon an open fight between the two groups broke out. The Nichirokei accused the Sodomei of being run by 'the labour bureaucrat establishment', and in turn the Sodomei and the Shaminkei accused the Nichirokei of hijacking and turning labour organisations into their puppets. The Nichirokei's members were expelled from both the Sodomei and the Taishuto earlier this month, and the group is now operating independently.

They also demand the members of the police unit responsible for the deaths of the two workers be brought to justice.

#Scripter's Note:
#
#  Below two 'The Aftermath' events were originally scripted as a part of the syndicalist revolution chain, starting from event 252009,
#  but (admittedly) the chain was too implausible and later discarded by collective decision of the KR developers.
#  I commented out these lines for possible future use.
#  I had planned to assign event id 252011 to the 'Syndicalist Revolution' event itself but since the chain is no more, the id is free to use.

desc = EVT_252021_DESC	#Restorationism was an idea promoted by radical junior officers, characterized by its anti-capitalism, anti-oligarchism and anti-parliamentarism. Usually coming from underprivileged and/or humble backgrounds, many of these officers have experienced poverty from childhood and observed what they considered the evil influence of favoritism, leading them to believe that the establishment has hijacked power from the Emperor and is leading the nation into the abyss. The Restorationist solution was to sweep out the ruling establishment and restore all power back to the Emperor (hence 'restoration', or 'ishin' in Japanese), and from there a complete national reform was to be initiated. Against them were the so-called Centralists, who were close to the central military leadership (thus the name, 'chuo' in Japanese), supported cooperation with the establishment, and the militarization of politics.

General Obata believes the Japanese economy is inadequate to sustain any kind of total warfare, and due to volatile international tensions, war would come to Japan before the country could ever achieve such a capability through internal development. Accordingly, he came to the conclusion that in future wars, the IJA must seek the quick destruction of hostile forces by waging war through short, rapid, and decisive operations, to avoid a long war. Since any long-term war strategy is futile to him, Obata places high priorities on operational planning and field initiative. General Nagata's analysis is nearly identical, but he has come to a different conclusion, and argues that building up a total war capable army should be the top objective. He calls for expanding our mobilization capability, modernizing equipment, and centralizing the command structure.

The Act drastically limited civil rights and symbolized the draconian rule of General Tanaka. It was repealed when the regime was brought down by the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but Prime Minister Suzuki Kisaburo now wants to reintroduce the Act, albeit heavily moderated and renamed the 'National Security Act'. He has met strong opposition even within his own cabinet, and public opinion has dropped to a new low, but Suzuki believes its reintroduction is a necessary step to counter the rising tide of syndicalism, and he is not alone in his opinion. A cross-party parliamentary group led by Nakajima Chikuhei of the Rikken Seiyukai and Adachi Kenzo of the Minseito have declared the Act as the 'last bulwark of constitutional government' and support its passage. The House of Peers and the Privy Council are also in favor of the Act.

To this end, not only must Japan's economic structure be reorganised along a militarist line, but the Japanese people must be 'ideologically enlightened' to abandon self-interest. They must abandon class struggle, which is harmful to national security, and restructure society along a moral economic line.

The second group is the Kodoha (Imperial Way Faction), named after General Araki's frequent usage of the word 'Imperial Way', or 'Kodo', composed of reserve or active Restorationist military leaders. Third is the Yokuseiha, mainly composed of former parliamentary politicians who sympathised with the Restorationist cause. The name 'Yokuseiha' originated from an abbreviation of a political association of Restorationist sympathisers, the Yokusan Seijikai (Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association). The latter two object to the Kakushina's forceful agenda, and even question the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai. Konoe had designed the Taisei Yokusankai as a central nervous system of the upcoming 'New System', combining all legislative, executive and administrative powers into one. Konoe assured that the old Meiji Constitution would remain as it is and the Taisei Yokusankai would not replace the Imperial Diet, but the very idea of the political leviathan has met with vigorous opposition.

desc = EVT_252051_DESC	#During the Rikken Seiyukai convention of 1936, Nakajima had felt his leading role was insecure and made power-sharing agreements with other factions. One such agreement was that the powerful post of the Secretary-General would remain vacant (but not abolished), with its tasks transferred to the collective leadership of the General Council. Last month, believing he had solidified his position, Nakajima attempted complete his domination by capturing the office of Secretary-General. To this end, he formally advised the General Council to return the post to former Secretary-General Kuhara Fusanosuke, who sympathized with the Reformists, and on April 28th Nakajima and his clique formed the 'Kakushin Domei' (Reformist Alliance), effectively a party within a party, pressing the General Council even further. After the general election had concluded, on May 14th the pro-Nakajima chairman of the General Council Horikiri Zenbe forced the issue to a vote within the Council, but the motion was vetoed by all other factions. Isolated within the upper echelons, the Reformists tried to overcome the situation by calling a convention to mobilize their local party cadres, but this was turned down by all other non-Reformist leaders again, frustrating Nakajima even more. Today, just a month after the election, the Kakushin Domei formally declared its independence from the Rikken Seiyukai.

Fortunately, the drought is mostly affecting southern Korea, western Honshu and the southern islands, and although rice harvests have dropped significantly no state of famine has developed. However the disruption to food production from the drought is severe enough to force us to close down several rice exchanges, including the famous Dojima Rice Exchange, and control the rice supply directly, at least for the time being.
