Fearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Generaux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently other than Blum himself, the still respected general Maurice Gamelin.

The Paris Trial aimed to prove that Blum and his associates had undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defenses against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin remained silent throughout; refusing to recognize the courts right to try him. The trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they                          # have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free.

We have received word via secret channels that Gamelin is willing to recognise our Republic in return for aid in defeating the Jacobins. Although considered one of the worst traitors France has ever seen for leading the reds in the first civil war which saw us reduced to our exile in Algiers, this could be our best chance to return home and drive out the craven Communards that stole it from us.
