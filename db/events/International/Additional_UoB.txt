Having seen the difficulties apparent in France's attempts at complete nationalization and collectivization, the current British ethos is not one of an entirely state directed economy - instead the TUC prefers to allow economic freedom at the local level backed up by strong workers' rights, welfare support and a democratization of the workplace in the form of co-operatives as both the private and public company are banned as forms of business organization. Major industrial concerns are nationalized and run by their respective Trade Unions with supervision from the Congress. The chairman of the TUC is the nominal head of state, but the government is generally seen by British citizens as a collective entity - decisions are made by voting for a simple majority and all un			               # ions are committed to respecting the majority ruling. Representatives are elected to the TUC by direct elections standing as nominally independent candidates, though in practice most coalesce in groups around certain ideals despite political parties being banned as formal organizations.
