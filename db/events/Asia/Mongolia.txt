Because of the assassination, Russia has fallen into domestic chaos and will thus not be interested nor capable of intervening in domestic Mongolian politics. Roman Ungern von Sternberg understands that this is the right time to make Mongolia as great as it once was, but he needs a skilled second in command to succeed. Will he choose his loyal general from the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Boris Rezukhin? Or maybe the current head of government, the Mongolian aristocrat Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren to further consolidate his popularity with the Mongol people? Finally the religious leader, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, could be chosen to guarantee Ungern's divine status and prove his direct reincarnation as the God of War?

With most of Central Asia in his hands, Ungern Khan rules all Mongolic peoples and everyone living in a yurt swears allegiance to him alone. A man beyond the capabilities of other mortals, Ungern is thought of by many Mongolians as an avatar of the God of War or in the very least – as a reincarnation of the great Genghis Khan and with his newest victories those doubting these claims have been reduced to a mere handful. Fuelled by the sweet fruits of victory Ungern Khan has convened a grand assembly in Urga to manifest the triumph of Mongolia’s recent conquests. The question, however, remains whether or not the Mad Baron will satisfy himself with the establishment of a  Greater Mongolia or take his faithful tribal forces and his hardened Savage Division further on the path of ambition, madness and glory?

The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government. Commanders loyal to the Khan were arrested without any warning and all major sites in Urga occupied by the putschists. As the rebels stormed the Baron’s residence, Ungern viciously defended himself shooting several leading conspirators in a desperate firefight. However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself. Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan came to an end.

It was generally believed that he was a reincarnation of Genghis Khan and as such didn’t care much about his original Russian upbringing. But when Ungern was overthrown and his generals took power, the Mongol population was deeply disappointed with the successors’ behavior. The former commanders of Ungern's army considered themselves Russians and ruled Mongolia as if were a colony and not their motherland. This oppression combined with the strictness of a military regime caused a wave of riots in the Mongolian army (which consisted of various tribesmen under command of steppe nobility). Leaders of the Mongol tribes under command of noyan (aristocratic title for tribe leaders) Amagaiin Bajudai started a massive anti-government revolt under the slogan of ‘Mongolian tribes against the Russian oppressors’. Soon a wave of terror covered the steppes...
