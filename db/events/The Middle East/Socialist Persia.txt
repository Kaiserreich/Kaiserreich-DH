First conceived by Russian businessmen, it took decades of negotiations before a Société d'Etudes representing the unified interests of the Entente can help start the project. This meant that only small portions of the network were complete by the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. The subsequent defeat and collapse of the Entente powers meant that construction came to a halt. The fighting during the civil war further devastates what little rails there were. But now, as we've firmly established ourselves as the rightful government, it would be wise to look back on some of these plans for any future constructions.

Had Kuchik Khan and his clique of clergymen and landowners been allowed to run the country, the situation for the people would not be much different from their times under the Shah.  The elites and sheiks would continue to run the country while the peasantry continues to toil away, ignorant of their rights to their lands. Recent reports have shown that the Jangalis might have hindered the land redistribution program on purpose. Many land sectors still remain the same while in others, farmers receive the bare minimum to start cultivating their crops. We must amend this travesty as soon as possible.

Control over them is loose at best and most of the time non-existent due to their nomadic nature, making it hard to maintain our records. Another difficulty in dealing with them, ironically, is their organizational ability. Most of the tribes are centrally managed by strong and powerful chieftains, though there are some differences between the powerful, centralized tribal chiefdoms of our western province with their broad pastoral bases and the independent, hardy, egalitarian Pashtun mountain villagers near the eastern borderlands with Afghanistan. During the civil war, many did take up arms against both our government and the enemy's, though the majority avoids any fighting if possible. One thing is undeniable, however, in order to advance Persia forward, we must find a way to negotiate with these chiefs, for they hold much political sway over their respective population and controls vital resources and key points throughout the country

Not only would tax collection be reformed through the public oversight committee, but the public would also be able to see what their money is spent on through the expenditure committee. Now elected Premier of the Republic, Mossadegh can attempt to reintroduce these proposals.

As the two men run for their bought-off security guards, the crowds start to close in on their house. Their houses were rocked, windows were broken and the general secretaries were scared the living daylights out of them. Some protestors had insisted that they had heard the strict secularist Radmandesh pray to Allah for salvation while his house was under siege. Just before their doors were broken down and the general secretaries possibly lynched by the vengeful mob, Khalil Maleki and Noureddin Alamouti conveniently intervened. Asserting themselves as the reformist wing, Malek and Alamouti promise a shift in the Tudeh doctrine from orthodox syndicalism to democratic socialism, much to the horror of the paralyzed general secretaries. Meanwhile, high-ranking Internationale yes-men in the Tudeh Party across the country were arrested for treason. Any militant cells and the TPMO were quickly put down thanks to internal documents from Maleki and Alamouti. Haydar Khan and his entourage were nowhere to be seen, however, though reports suggest that he has crossed into Armenia.

By then Majlis was finally free of foreign influence and decided to pursue monetary reforms. Internal unrest and the civil war delayed the establishment of a National Bank again,though the foundations were already there. The situation now is stable enough for us to commence the bank's opening and operation.
