### Qing domestic events by thegreatplant
####################
# Mod note, Jan 2024: Qing's internal reform events/decisions should be re-written to occur post-unification and be multifaceted & non-generic: tax/finance, mining, industry, education, & public health.
#	Also decisions for public works: railroad expansion, repair of the Grand Canal, & the Yangtze River Project (aka Three Gorges Dam).
# The initial reforms should be military oriented as Wu Peifu desires to forcibly bring China together:
#	Logistics (infrastructure + logistic blueprints), artillery & armor (brigades + blueprints) & aircraft (tactical bombers + blueprints).
# Perhaps the starting land doctrine should also become a choice: Light Infantry & Methodical Battle (Defensive Focus) would be most appropriate, but Manpower & Firepower Focus could be available too.
