desc = EVT_100000_DESC # Formed in 1924 as a result of the Consolidation Of Resources Act, the Australasian Confederation is the combination of the British Antipode Dominions, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the territories of British New Guinea and Fiji. The years since the Weltkrieg, in which Australian and New Zealand forces served with distinction, have brought great change and hardship. The war strained both society and the economy, which in Australia manifested itself in the short lived Melbourne Commune. Although disowned by the then ruling Labour government and put down by demobilized Australian Imperial Force veterans, this resulted in the implementation of the Emergency Protocols, the suspension of elections and the appointment of William Birdwood as Governor General. Then the British Revolution of 1925 shook the Empire to the core and Australasia was unable to prevent the loss of territories to the Germans. More than 10 years on the situation is still unstable as the economy remains
# stagnant and domestic dissent continues to grow; with Birdwood alongside his ally Billy Hugh's Nationalist Party, barely holding things together.

desc = EVT_100001_DESC # Elections in the Antipodes were suspended by the Emergency Protocols enacted in 1923 which also led to the dissolving of the autonomy of the separate New Zealand Parliament. However, elections are now set for March this year after Stanley Bruce successfully campaigned for their reintroduction. Governor-General Birdwood was forced to make this concession when Bruce defeated Hughes for the leadership of the Nationalist Party and although Bruce's decision not to act as unelected Prime Minister resulted in the expulsion of his faction from the Nationalist Party and Hughes' recall as PM, the public would not accept the government reneging on it's commitments. Australasia can ill afford a repeat of 1929 - the specter of Melbourne remains fresh in the minds of many.

desc = EVT_100004_DESC # Originally formed in 1925, the Australasian 'New' Guard is a staunchly nationalist and jingoistic organization which can trace its roots back to the paramilitary organizations of demobilized servicemen returning from the Great War (the 'Old' Guard) who helped put down the 1923 Melbourne Commune. In the years following the Victoria rising, the New Guard have continued to support the government, with many supporters joining the expanded security forces available to the Governor-General and New Guard members assisting in suppressing left wing activities. The coming return to democratic rule has caused an upset amongst the far right however, fearing the re-emergence of the long suppressed Labour movement and that the Nationalist Party, divided as it is between the Guard and United Australasia will be unable to maintain the status quo. Due to these factors, the New Guard's leader Eric Campbell, has decided that the Guard will take part in the elections as the Centre                                                # Party. Despite their not inconsiderable levels of popular support, at present it is unsure what impact they will have though.

The CTU wants to seize this opportunity to enact real socialist policies throughout Australasia, form a republic in memory of the Melbourne Commune and break from the imperialist Entente. Lang wishes to expel them from the party, maintaining our place in the Empire. Curtin must make a choice; break his party or lead a revolution.

This resulted in territory being lost to foreign powers, foremostly the German Reich.

Now that Australasia is once again beginnning to asert it's independence many are calling for a clarification of the governments foreign policy. The most obvious course is to reafirm our commitment to the Entente alliance, while others are suggesting we distance ourselfs from it in order to better develop                         # our own nation. Anderson, the sitting Governor of New South Wales is calling for a renewed Australasia to commit to completing what she was unable to accomplish in 1925 - the reclamation and protection of the British territories in Asia and the Pacific region.

While Canada, the most senior British colony was able to facilitate the Exodus from the Home Isles and secure British possessions in the New World, Australasia wasn't in a position to mount comparable operations in the Pacific. This resulted in territory being lost to foreign powers, foremostly the German Reich. Admiral David Murray Anderson, commander of the China Station in 1925, enacted what would later be termed the 'Anderson Protocol' where he evacuated colonial personal and civilians to Australasia, there combining the British fleet with the Australasians to form the current Australasian Station. Now that Australasia is once again beginning to assert it's independence many are calling for a clarification of the governments foreign policy. The most obvious course is to reaffirm our commitment to the Entente alliance, while others are suggesting we distance ourselves from it in order to better develop                         # our own nation. Anderson, the sitting Governor of New South Wales is calling for a renewed Australasia to commit to completing what she was unable to accomplish in 1925 - the reclamation and protection of the British territories in Asia and the Pacific region. While dangerously revanchist, this 'Anderson Doctrine' is fast gaining popularity.

This purge of the NSW party has since rippled throughout the Confederation with Lang's supporters of moderate social populists and anti-Syndicalist union supporters ostracizing and marginalizing their more leftist opponents. This 'Great Schism' of the Australasian Labour Party has firmly separated the Antipodean worker's movement into a reformist and populist rump Labour Party and a revolutionary movement consolidating around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. Yet all is not well in Labour since friction still exists between Lang and the popular John J. Curtin.

In Australia, two consecutive plebsticies about the introduction of conscription were narrowly defeated, leaving the ANZACs and other Antipodean units strictly volunteer-only. However, with the Entente's defeat and the ensuring German expansion in the Pacific following the 1925 British Revolution, the federal government has been anxious about strengthening the fighting capabilities of the Australasian army, navy and air force. Today, the results of the National Defence Review have proposed increasing the military's training strength and funding as a result of the rising tension in Europe and Asia. Some see it as a staging point for the government to launch a campaign arguing for the introduction of conscription and the need for a swift militarization of the Antipodean dominions.

Several governments had attempted to enforce it through plebiscites, but were defeated - sometimes narrowly - at the polling stations. However, several leading members of the incumbent administration argue that the time has come for a new attempt at replacing the volunteer ANZAC forces with a conscription-based and better trained armed forces. Such a 'conscription campaign' could either strengthen the government if successful or potentially break it - and thus strengthening the extremes of Australasia's political scene - if failing. Either way, the amount of money the government is prepared to spend on this campaign will be an indicator of failure as well as success.

However, complications have arisen since New Zealand overwhelmingly voted no to confederate conscription whilst Australians mainly voted yes. Although a majority for conscription has been achieved, it would be dangerous for our nation's union to impose it on the New Zealanders. Some members of cabinet have proposed that we let the various administrative regions implement conscription on a local level, thus allowing the Kiwis to maintain their volunteer-based army units.

While the results showed that the RAN is still a force to be reckoned with, it is beginning to fall behind the other powers in the Pacific. A number of our ships are now considerably out of date and the lack of modern capital ships is a noticable weakness. To rectify this a programme of modernisation has been proposed to bring the older vessels up to speed. Expanding our number of capital ships has also been suggested, but as we are currently lacking the advanced shipyards and drydocks required we would either have to begin a significant infrastucture project to enable Australasia to buil these ships ourselves. An alternative to this is to instead tender this contract out to another country's shipbuilders.

With these improvements in place, we can begin construction of a new series of capital ships, the pride of which will be a super-heavy battleship named for George V.

Sharing his fate is Eric Campbell, a senior figure in the New Guard movement and leader of it's political wing - the Centre Party, as well as many other prominent members. The New Guard has now been dissolved and the Centre Party banned. Charles Vyner Brooke unfortunately could not be linked directly to the coup and so escaped a prison sentence, although many say he bribed those involved in his prosecution. He has since distanced himself from public life, much to the satisfaction of the present government.

Despite fighting together alongside Britain in the Great War and staying true to the Empire after 1925, succesive Canadian governments have continued to keep Australasia at arms length due in no small part to a protectionist attitude - not wishing for their own farmers to be out competed by Australasian imports. As such, no bilateral trade agreement exists between the two Dominions. Now however, with Canada's increasing military build-up to prepare for the retaking of the Home Islands and the collapse in trade with the United States due to the instability there, the Canadians may be amenable to allowing us to increase exports to them. This would allow Canada to release men and resources for other war-related services, such as the military or arms production.

The situation was different however in China where the presence of the other international powers, wary of the Reich dominating foreign trade, helped to maintain the status quo - this lead ultimately to the formation of the Legation Cities. The British concessions have largely integrated into this system - the Governor of Hong Kong, Cecil Clementi, is the current head of the Legations Council and former British colonial units make up a significant part of the Legations defence forces. The primary conduit of international trade in and out of China, the Legation Cities amass considerable profits for their foreign owners, ourselves among them.

The Brooke family, with the support of the Australasian government have set about a program of establishing British rule in the region again. In addition to Sarawak, Brooke has established a protectorate over Sabah and accepted the submission of the Sultan of Brunei. The area's bountiful natural resources have seen large investments both by the Brooke family themselves and Australasian corporations. This has seen an economic boom in Kuching and Brunei, where infrastructure has been expanded. In the face of all this rapid change, Charles Brooke's popularity with his erstwhile subjects remains good, largely due to his hands-off approach which fosters native traditions.

name = EVT_100190_NAME # A Conference in July
desc = EVT_100190_DESC # The Australasian Labor Party has convened for its first Federal Conference since Curtin's narrow ascension into the office of Prime Minister today. The main agenda was party unity and how Curtin should deal with the two breakaway wings of the Labor, which split from the Federal branch in 1931. /nThe first, the National Labor Party, is made up of followers of Joseph Lyons, the former Premier of Tasmania who left the Federal Labor caucus in 1930 following disagreements with Ted Theodore and the Federal A.L.P's handling of the economic crisis. After a brief stint in the U.A.P, Lyons would then leave the U.A.P due to its support of Birdwood's heavy-handed approach towards his duties as Governor-General, forming the National Labor Party as a de-jure successor to the party of the same name in 1918. National Labor now stands in an interesting position as a kingmaker with ties to both the U.A.P and Labor Party. Furthermore, the N.L.P has become increasingly appealing to some moderates, many of whom are concerned by Donald Grant and his Industrial-Labor group, deemed by many as a syndicalist cell within the party. Leftists within the party will be greatly dissatisfied by Lyons'  return as he's generally viewed as reactionary within the camp due to his past association with the U.A.P and his support of fiscally conservative economic policies. n/The second, Lang Labor or more formally known as the New South Wales Labor Party, is made up of supporters of Jack Thomas Lang, the infamous former governor of New South Wales, known for his extremist and militant attitude. Lang's split from the party would come when he denounced the Premiers' Plan to combat the economic downturn in the 20s and put forth his plan for economic recovery, titled the Lang Plan. His defiance of the federal caucus and radicalism would split the party along its radical left and right-wing, with Lyons leading the fiscally conservative right-wing and Lang leading the deflationary left. Lang would however be removed from office by governor Philip Game after his instructions for public servants not to pay money into the Federal Treasury, which was deemed illegal. Though removed from office, Lang would continue to wield much influence within New South Wales and even sought to usurp the position of Federal leader before Curtin's ascension. Reunification with the New South Wales caucus would mean a great boost to our position in parliament, but it carries with it Langite risk that's unpredictable to the extreme. Our moderates will also become angered by Lang's return and may seek to join Lyons' camp as a result.

Considering that the wars of the future will be fought in the air, this is a grave concern for the ANZAC High Command. However, it is not just aircraft that we are currently falling behind at. Australasia's air defense is at an abysmal state right now, barely able to fight off monoplanes and biplanes, much less new fighters and bombers. Airbase distribution is also a concern, as our airfields are sparse and unevenly spread, leaving the Northern Territory and Queensland exposed to a hypothetical German invasion from Papua. All of these problems combined make reforming the RAAF a matter of life or death for Australasia.

As of right now, this dam is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, costing the state governments of Victoria and New South Wales nearly 6 million dollars. The dam originated from the need for water conservation after The Federation Drought. In 1903, a royal commission was sent to the River Murray, which then recommended the construction of a dam on the Upper Murray at Cumberoona. The commission also presided over the River Murray Waters Agreement. This agreement formalized the conditions for the dam's construction and water sharing between the three states bordering the river. Construction then began in November 1919. Owing to the scale of the project, a significant amount of land was resumed. This totaled 102,850 acres across Victoria and New South Wales. Many displeased residents and landowners appealed, undertaking legal action to combat construction on their properties, lasting for nearly a decade but did not halt progress. And now that the great work is completed, farming in the Upper Murray basin enters into a new phase. The menace of drought has been removed and whole districts have been placed in a position of safety.

These specimens are called "Si-e" by the Koita of Port Moresby and "Aou-angi-angi" by the Eboa of Makeo, both roughly translating to "man-devourer". Local stories about these lizards say that they come at night to eat the bodies of the dead. There have also been various incidences where these creatures were indicated as the culprits. The most notable reports are when a native reported seeing his wife consumed by these creatures, and another where a native tried to rescue his dog from a Si-e, only to be eaten himself. With Mr. Champion's report, their existence seems indisputable, but we are still not sure about the true nature of these creatures. Various theories about them have been put forth, with some speculating that they are in fact Komodo Dragons first found in Malaya, while others remain in doubt about the existence of "tree-alligators" at all.

This is not to mention the constant conflicts between native tribes and the impossible terrain, described by one account as "it was easier to ascend the highest peaks of the European Alps with an alpenstock than to cross an ordinary hill in Papua". Despite all of this, William MacGregor, the first administrator of British New Guinea managed to bring about a state of order after his tenure. The situation had remained calm until the start of the Weltkrieg, where Papua would experience wartime difficulties. Germany's victory and the subsequent collapse of the Empire would grind its administration to a halt when the Consolidation of Resources forced the colonial government to make do with the bare minimum. Now that the situation has somewhat settled for us, it would be wise to take a look to see how Papua is holding up and provide them with more resources or allow for reforms where necessary.

desc = EVT_100701_DESC # With the all preparations finally in place, the first Congress of Australasian Trade Unions is about to be inaugurated in Melbourne. The race to set the new path for Australasian socialism promises to be a fierce between all participating parties. Most moderate socialists and former Labor leaders have coalesced around the Industrial-Labor Party under the leadership of former Victorian Senator Donald Cameron and famous champion of civil rights Maurice Blackburn. The Syndicalist Federation on the other hand is a mix of more orthodox syndicalists and more hardline socialists with Percy Laidler as their leader. Rumors have it however that the Syndicalist Federation is increasingly fragmenting between its 'Neosocialist' and 'Federationist' wings, reconciled only by their common acceptance of Percy Laidler's leadership and contempt for other forces within the ACTU. - That leaves us with the black horse of the race for leadership of Syndicalist Australasia, the National-Workers' Union. Composed of more nationalist elements and Australasian exiles from Europe influenced by the 'Totalist Charter', the party is currently struggling to gain support due to its extraordinary proposals regarding cultural and economic reorganisation. Percy Stephensen, the leader of the NWU, has however promised to carry his party through the ACTU election no matter what and has also promised that if successfully elected, he and his party will be uncompromising in their drive to build not only a new socialist Australasia, but a new Australasia altogether.

Although he was ultimately unsuccessful in pursuing socialism for Australasia, the legacy of his work still influences Australasian socialism till this day.

Ending his letter by reminiscing about his time within the Australian labor movement, Mann also hints at the possibility of significant assistance coming from Britain in the near future.

Ties to the industrialised and prosperous Internationale leaders in Western Europe would be an enormous boost to our economy, not to mention our familiarity with London and Europe in general. However as initially benificial as these ties may be, the brewing storms of war in Europe may shatter our economic connections at a moment's notice. Moreover, many of our advisors are wary of being dependant on Europe once again not long after we've thrown off the shackles of imperial domination. Therefore many have proposed instead that we strengthen ties instead with Asia, especially to our comrades in the Indian subcontinent, where they argue that Australasia must play an esssential role in aiding revolutionary efforts. The Americas is also a front we can explore, but little attention have been paid to our diplomatic efforts there when compared with Europe and Asia.

Contrary to our hopes, we had managed to further our ties with many Latin American states. Our strengthened ties will greatly help us by providing Australasia with access to LATAM markets and resources. In Argentina, our diplomatic mission secretly met up with Tom Barker, former leader of the Australasian IWW who was exiled following a wave of suppression by the Labor government during the first Weltkrieg. The former union boss praised our revolutionary triumph over the royalists. While he intents to return to visit Red Australasia one day, for now Barker will remain in Patagonia to help organise the workers there, the region having becoming a second home to him.

After all, a decade of military rule under William Birdwood has shown them the excesses of the reactionary system enforced by the British. It therefore falls to us to restore faith in the ANZAC by turning it into an army of the people and for the people. Already plans are underway to cultivate a new, revolutionary officers corps and reorganise the ANZAC High Command, both known hotbeds for reactionary sleep agents. However there have been arguments on how much should be changed with the army. Should it remain similar in structure or perhaps changed to a system of popular militia units intended solely for self-defense, like advocated by Maurice Blackburn?.

Declaring Australasia's economy a 'monstrosity of colonialism', having been built only to serve Anglo interests, Stephensen promised self-sufficiency and self-empowerment to millions of Australasians. However, within the ANWU apparatus there have been major debates on how to carry Stephensen's plan forward. Is Australasia to rapidly industrialise in order to assert itself as a Pacific powerhouse?, or should development be more grounded and local by building on the foundations of our already existing ecoomic base instead of breaking away completely?

Public reception has been a mix of confusion and reluctance, even in some cases outright hostility against the Jindyworobak Package.

The Blackburn Plan, in short, "does not seek to abolish private ownership of any of the instruments of production where such instrument is utilised byits owner in a socially useful manner and without exploitation".

Even after the supposed end of military rule, big name newspapers were still under the control of reactionary oligarchs and interest groups hellbent on stamping out the Labor movement. Therefore a restructuring and liberalisation of the press have always been core tenants for Industrial Labor and their leaders.

However, their control has never been quite secure due to the sheer size of Indonesia and the complexity of native power structures. Therefore they've always governed indirectly through local leaders, much like how the British did in India. The German economic collapse plus looming the threat of war in Europe has greatly weakened their presence in the Indies.
