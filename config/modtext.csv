BSR_NAME;1925 British Revolution;;;;;;;;;;x
BSR_U07;Britain was already defeated before the Peace with Honour. The second battle for Jutland undermined the power of the Royal Navy, and the Spring Offensive undermined geopolitical power. After the war the country plunged into depression, faced famine, unemployment, and distrust of power. In the December 1921 elections, the majority won the Conservatives, the seats were won by the Labour and Nationals, and the Liberals split between supporters and opponents of the alliance with Bonar Law. The Prime Minister, who was ill with laryngeal cancer, offered in 1923 his seat to the Marquees Curzon of Kedleston. Under attack for the breach of democratic protocol and destabilizing of a slumping economy, the Tories called an election less than a year later to win a mandate. The results of which for the Conservatives were a disaster: majority was preserved only with the help of a coalition with the National. At the beginning of 1925, tariffs on goods from Germany and its puppet states were introduced in strict form, such a decision initially brought about a short-term rise in production. However, Germany introduced its own tariffs on British goods, and shipped goods through Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands. The coal industry was the worst hit: the loss of the market has devastated entrepreneurs who laid off workers and lowed wages with others. Thus, the Trade Union Congress announced the beginning of a general strike on March 7. Loyalists are unreasonably afraid of escalating the strike into mass unrest. If not quickly pacified, Britain will be doomed.;;;;;;;;;;x
BSR_ENG;Trade Union Congress emerged in the 1860s, and since 1897 has positioned itself as a centralized union structure that uses a more militant approach to combating employers and even achieving a socialist transformation of society. Currently, the TUC includes 4 million workers, whose numbers have increased since the Great War. The seven-year conflict with the Central Powers has become a tragedy not only in terms of casualties. The illusion of Britain's domination of the world subsided long before the Peace with Honour was signed. Prolonged depression began, people were starving, businesses shut down on rails. The 'Wartime Coalition' paid for its defeat in the December 1921 election, where Liberals not only yielded to the majority of Conservatives but were divided on a party-by-party basis. The opposition was Labour, which included a faction of workers and radicals. In the 1924 election, the Independent Labour Party, which occupies a more left position, increased representation to 35 MPs, and announced the purpose of removing Curzon's cabinet in any way. Of particular concern was the introduction of tariffs on German goods, which initially gave a short-term positive effect. But the mirror response of the Reich doomed the industry to stagnation. The disadvantaged workers who are TUC members are openly inclined to overthrow the government and establish the sovereignty of the working class. After the failure of the compromise, it was not surprising that the statement of readiness to strike on March 7 was strongly supported by trade unionists, nationalists and radicals. There is no doubt that resistance in the event of dispersal will be tough, and this is the starting point of the Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;x
78001desc;They kept their word. Not recognizing the intentions of deteriorating working conditions for the benefit of the population, hundreds of thousands of workers left the job. They are supported by the indifferent people who see this revolution in the shoots. And already, the restless Britain plunged into chaos. Emergency status should fix this error.;;;;;;;;;;;X
78002desc;The riot flares up. Home Secretary Winston Churchill announces the partial mobilization of the army to keep a peace.;;;;;;;;;;;X
78003desc;It was sunny in London until a terrifying roar broke the silence. Violence erupted in the rebel-held capital. A group of anarchists gathered in the middle of Buckingham Palace, stormed the gates, surrounded the building and went inside. Without hesitation, they rushed to the royal residences and killed the king and his family. It is rumoured that from the beginning of the strike they had to sail to Canada and stay safe. Be that as it may, the Monarchy is in mourning, and the British are shocked and confused by the threat of a strike.;+;+;+;+;;;+;;;;X
78029desc;No one expected that the history that Britain would bring to dominate the world would loudly undermine it. Economic, political, humanitarian collapse, caused by the war with Germany, broke the nest of discord. Especially got to the miners who have to endorse the coal blockade. The United Kingdom is likely to face one of the strongest challenges: the TUC convenes a general strike on March 6. It is necessary to curb the flames as soon as possible, as long as it does not bury Britain in the chaos. A gloomy and hopeless spring promises to be fateful.;+;+;+;+;;;+;;;;X
78030desc;Enough! The bourgeoisie, which has brought Britain to a bloody nightmare, has risen above grief and despair, anger and hatred. People who suffer from their pride must serve them! They hoped that 'imperial tariffs' would heal the wound of the war: everything was in vain. From everywhere there are intentions to overthrow the old way. Preparations for a strike that touched millions of Britons began yesterday. Let the elite shake away from the rumble of the people and the Red Flag of this spring will be over.;+;+;+;+;;;+;;;;X
78031desc;The strike, which began as a peaceful avalanche, spread across Britain, reaching more and more people. Maclean's and Mosley's light-hearted speeches united indifferent workers. Fearful loyalists fled to Canada for weeks, leaving the country in the hands of the common people. Under the Red Flag, Parliament passed an act transferring power to the Trade Union Congress and dissolving itself. Out of the chaos emerges the syndicalist Union of Britain, which is only beginning to defend the interests of the proletariat.;;;;;;;;;;;X
78032desc;The strike, which began as a peaceful one, swept much of Britain. But loyalists were quick to navigate, slowing the progress of the trade unionists. As of now, there is a draw that means nothing. But the advantage of the Revolution was in the people who trusted in the overthrow of the capitalist system. And the day will come when a long struggle will bring a long-awaited triumph, but clearly not today.;;;;;;;;;;;X
78033desc;The Royal Army met angry protesters in full alert. With the least losses, we were able to put inexperienced strikers in place. The High Court found the strike illegal and the workers agreed to our demands. The United Kingdom is waking up from a prolonged depression, proving that the world map is not lost. The Royal Family solemnly returned from Canada, and a standing ovation was carried out by the citizens at Buckingham Palace. From here, George V said, 'No longer will anyone be allowed to encroach on the greatness of the British Empire. It is awakened!';;;;;;;;;;;X
78034desc;The insurgency was not easy, and now it has been a relentless draw. Yet loyalists stood in their hands and disorganized the trade unionists. The situation was normalized by divisions that came from Canada, and a further picture emerges in favour of King's supporters. And now for the sake of the result, we should wait.;;;;;;;;;;;X
FCW_NAME;French Civil War;;;;;;;;;;x
FCW_VIC;After five years of trench warfare and gruelling battles, the Western Front was breached by the Spring Offensive. France and England could no longer oppose the nefarious German force. The defence of Paris lasted for several more months, until we were embarrassed to sign an agreement with the Reich. It was obvious that the nation would not forgive this, but the worst thing was to bow to the trade unionists. They began to crush our "old" France and build a utopia on its ruins. Eventually, the CGT declared an ultimatum demobilised to justify a fratricidal war. Now that France is becoming an arena of battle between Republicans and Syndicalists, the Red Plague cannot be allowed to spread across Europe and possibly the world. The Republic must live!;;;;;;;;;;;X
FCW_FRA;France lived in vain hopes of revenge for the Sedan until this spring. The massive German offensive not only showed against the instability of the army, but also opened the eyes to the culprit of these problems: the obsolete and corrupt Republic (and with them the bourgeoisie)! Enlightened people began to take to the streets to change the order in the country. The strength of the CGT (Confederation Generale du Travail) grew day by day, even in parliament there were supporters of the overthrow of the republic. Eventually, after the Versailles capitulation, the left declared an ultimatum demobilised: either against the people or against the people. The general strike reached a new level and paralysed the domestic economy. Today is the time of the revolution, more majestic than 1789 and bloodier than 1871. If we destroy old France, we will be able to inspire the proletariat and establish the first state of the Commune. This is a history we write ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;X
79001desc;This spring showed the complete inability of Republicans to defend their country. The Germans broke through the front, the British left the mainland, and the French government capitulated for fear of the Kaiser's campaign. 'La Honte!' - the voices of the French people were heard both during the May Day demonstration and during the last month. The Versailles surrender was preceded by a general strike, a parliamentary boycott and clashes with the gendarmes. On November 1, the CGT issued an ultimatum to the army: are they with the people? Now the time is up. Another time has come - revolutionary.;;;;;;;;;;;X
79002desc;This spring showed that fighting the Germans on their own is useless. Under threat of complete defeat, we were forced to accept the conditions of the occupiers - to pay reparations, give Paris, to demobilize. All this angered the French, and most of all - the left. After our defeat, their support has grown many times over, and in the last month they have done everything to bring us to our knees. After the ultimatum, the goal of which was to support the demobilised, it became clear that a civil war was inevitable. We have nothing to lose, and if we want to see the Republic, we must fight to the end.;;;;;;;;;;;X
79015desc;The Great War ended not in favour of ordinary people. Agrarian Normandy became one of the arguments for this; rich rural industry declined, people did not return home, and the revolution killed the region's economy. True anarchy began, and over it stood Raymond Pericat, a supporter of Bolshevism, a critic of the CGT, who decided to arrange his own self-governing territory as an alternative to the syndicalist. One should not expect anything extraordinary from him, knowing that Pericat himself is easily bribed by the lures of the ideological assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;X
79027desc;Today a young man with dark blond hair and a normal face arrived at one of the stations. The only difference was the sharp, rebellious behaviour by which the anarchists were able to identify the person. This is Nestor Makhno, whose Black Army withheld the support of the peasants and wanted to create an anarchist utopia in the south-eastern lands of Ukraine. The occupation of Kharkiv alarmed the Hetmanate, and he prepared a professional army against the Free Territory. After the defeat of the Insurgent Army, Makhno remained in Ukraine for several months, where he heard the news of the French Revolution. Left anarchists treat Makhno as a robber and marauder, but he will still gain fame among the people.;;;;;;;;;;;X
79032desc;We were convinced of the weakness of the old Republic even when Foch's command did not benefit the front, when it was unable to escape the German breakthrough, and was forced to sign a surrender. The people spoke their word: workers, peasants, opponents of the old system took up the defence of the Revolution. The Republicans could not overcome them, and those who were lucky enough to reach the shore evacuated to Algeria, complaining of exile. The communes of France are celebrating the creation of a federation that will serve the proletariat. Mankind received the first successful example of the socialist revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;X
79033desc;After the defeat of the Germans, we were persuaded that the embittered people had disbanded the French Republic. But we managed to gather, go on the offensive and defeat the rebels. Disappointed members of the trade unionists surrender their weapons and leave their ranks. Although the revolution has been defeated, hard times await us: the Germans will want the northern border and unconditional adherence to Versailles. But the events of recent months have shown: hope is alive, and revenge sooner or later, but it will happen.;;;;;;;;;;;X
79034desc;France entered the Great War, to avenge the loss of Alsace-Lorraine and the painful forty-year defeat of Germany. This attempt could have failed in the first months of the war, when the Germans invaded Paris through neutral Belgium, and the British helped us hold on to the Western Front and cement it for many years. When Germany withdrew its troops to the Hindenburg Line in 1917, the Allies launched a successful offensive in Arras and a catastrophic one in Chemin des Dames, which led to the fall of Nivelles. As the US is still neutral and the uprisings paralyse the army, the French government decides to provide carte blanche to Ferdinand Foch. Attempts to appoint Petain as commander-in-chief were blocked by his 'pessimistic' nature and difficult relationship with British High-Command. Meanwhile, the situation for the Entente is deteriorating: morale has fallen to a minimum, Foch's success is meagre, trust between the French and British High-Command begins to waver. It was difficult in such a situation to prepare for the enemy's attack, the Spring Offensive, which began on March 2nd 1919. The rapid breakthrough of the Germans near St. Mihiel broke the Western Front and cut off communication and supply lines. The Entente retreated to Paris and stabilized for several months. A miraculous counter-breakthrough in the Oise region deludes the French leadership into thinking that a last-ditch offensive could reach the beleaguered British forces. However, the rear front collapses however and with production coming to a halt, the French Army soon finds itself unable to continue fighting as desertion and mutinies deliver the final blows.;;;;;;;;;;;X
79035desc;Confirming that the fall of Paris was inevitable, on October 4th 1919, the French went to Versailles to sign a armistice with the Germans. The French felt offended. When the Kaiser and his own guard held a parade on the Champs Elysees, the people whistled at the probable perpetrators of the tragedy - the Briand government, the bourgeoisie, the aristocracy. The working class and the military were especially furious, among whom were left-wing ideas with growing radicalism. The strikes almost halted industry, students protested in the streets, and the Socialists boycotted parliament. On November 1st, the Treaty of Versailles was signed, a peace with harsh, degrading conditions, which finally levelled old France in the eyes of the people. According to her, the northeast of France was occupied by the Germans, they captured Paris 'for the sake of stability', the government ordered to pay grand reparations, and the French army was to be demobilised. The patience of the people broke, the gendarmes could not cope with the situation on their own. The CGT ultimatum became a natural wick that ignited the revolution: it supported demobilised rebel soldiers and threatened to take up arms against those who remained with the Republicans. This too daring act finally split the country in half.;;;;;;;;;;;X
79036desc;The General Confederation of Labour (Confederation Generale du Travail) was founded in September 1895 in Limoges. The Great War greatly affected the CGT. In the first year of the war, workers were mobilized to the front, which destroyed trade union branches and led to a sharp reduction in contributions. The standard of living remained calm, although the reorientation to military needs led to high inflation. The trade union movement was organized against the war, and for the last three years industrial centres experienced significant uprisings, such as protests against the introduction of a new wage scale in April 1917 or strikes in the Loire department in November of that year. The situation at the front became tense: disappointed soldiers in the trenches paralysed half the army, Foch successfully restored discipline, but the lack of decisive attacks lowered morale throughout the war and caused a conflict between French and British high commands. In opposition to the unstable army, the CGT organized a defence committee in May 1918, organizing walkouts in solidarity with the protesters. The CGT welcomed the Spring Offensive with 1.6M members who were hostile to the government, which broke the front of the Germans. In general, the failures of the French in the war and the feeling of a future revenge fiasco shed light on radical action.;;;;;;;;;;;X
79037desc;A large-scale general strike has engulfed France, with one million workers taking to the streets calling for the country not to give in to the victors and to protect their rights. The grand May Day demonstration gathered 250,000 people in Paris, including the military. Local administrations were seized in Lyon, Dijon, and Saint-Etienne. After a summer break, the protests resumed with greater force on October 4, when France signed the armistice at Versailles. The outrage of the French crossed all borders, riots and strikes swept through every department, the CGT officially declared the culprits of the defeat: Clemenceau with Briand, the head of government, and above them - the aristocrats and the bourgeoisie. Socialists and Syndicalists in parliament boycotted and declared themselves allies of the CGT. On November 1, when the Treaty of Versailles, which was destructive for old France, was signed, the CGT issued an ultimatum to the remaining soldiers: either with the people or against the people. The deadline expired today, but patience ran out a long time ago. A painting more majestic than 1789 and bloodier than 1871 must be transmitted. The time to make a revolution is more successful than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;X
SCW_NAME;Spanish Civil War;;;;;;;;;;x
SCW_SPA;The precarious situation of the Spanish monarchy was irreparably disturbed. When, under fear of rebellion, Alfonso XII approved the Dictabland government, he was unlikely to worry about Carlists or anarchists. After Black Monday, the weakness of power became apparent to almost everyone, and opponents of the monarchy raised their heads. How will the Bourbons cope with the ripe fruit of popular dislike?;;;;;;;;;;;X
SCW_SPR;After the defeat of the Spaniards in the war for Cuba, radical working groups began to receive support, especially in republican Catalonia. CNT-FAI, firmly linked since the general strike of 1917, tried to ignite revolutionary fervour, as in Britain or France, but to no avail. The unprecedented unrest in the East and the anarchy that came out of it served as a horn for the syndicalists. Will the fraternal help of the International be enough for the Revolution to take place?;;;;;;;;;;;X
SCW_EUS;Carlists are a phenomenon peculiar to Spain. It is a powerful, long-running far-right movement that stands for the restoration of the descendants of the Don Carlos line and that defends regionalism. The current contender for the throne, Francis Xavier, successfully took advantage of the economic crisis of 1936 and enlisted the support of Catholic states. On his side - the rural north and fearless racketeering. But won't these starting positions be enough for the Carlists to sit on the throne?;;;;;;;;;;;X
SCW_53desc;After three and a half years of struggle, none of the forces was able to take control of most of Spain, dooming it to terrible ruin. The entire country turned into a wasteland soaked with the blood of a generation of Spanish young men and women. Against the background of the unfolding Weltkrieg, neither side is going to retreat, although aware of what an illustration of the terrible war was Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;X
FV_NAME;Kutuzov: Invasion of Mitteleuropa;;;;;;;;;;x
FV_GER;The German war machine was re-launched in France, crushing local syndicalists and occupying Paris for the third time. Meanwhile, relations between Germany and Russia deteriorated, and Savinkov has since come to power. In revenge for the long-standing defeat, he intervened to weaken Mitteleuropa, and gained the support of anti-German organizations. The death of Wilhelm II struck us deeply, but the Russians scoffed at it. Only the Vozhd' can so heartlessly find the moment of invasion of us. The still uncrowned Wilhelm III will be baptized in fire on the eastern borders of the Reich.;;;;;;;;;;;X
FV_POL;Poland was rebuilt after the Weltkrieg in shabby condition. The election of the king was fierce, and ended with the election of Lithuanian ruler Mindaugas. He re-announced the Commonwealth, which comforted the Poles and Lithuanians. However, the threat of Savinkov's expansion did not leave us, and the death of Wilhelm II foretells something wrong. Will we not lose our freedom under any Russian cauldron?;;;;;;;;;;;X
FV_UBD;The Baltic Duchy plays the role of the 'Eastern Rampart of the Empire'. The campaign to attract German immigrants, launched 5 years ago, angered the indigenous population. Russophiles and nationalists, who have organized a strong alliance, are resisting 'forced colonization'. They have enlisted the support of Russia, and in light of the coming war it poses a blatant threat. Will the rampart that is torn out stand?;;;;;;;;;;;X
FV_BLR;For twenty years, Germany, dependent on Germany, was nourished by its help, not least by Sigismund. He did not succumb to the instructions of Russophile ministers or nationalist groups. The failed assassination attempt on the king only strengthened his power, and he retaliated against numerous Russian-speakers. They prefer Mother Russia to fictitious independence. Perhaps it is not for nothing that Russian troops are standing at the border to attack us unexpectedly?;;;;;;;;;;;X
FV_UKR;Ukraine is one of the important components of Mitteleuropa, its agricultural base. The rule of the compromise Vasyl Habsburg is not to the liking of all political forces. The explosion on the Dnieper stunned society, and the nationalists prevailed when Skoropadsky ascended the throne. He took seriously the formation of the Ukrainian consciousness, which outraged the Russophiles and Russia itself, which sponsors them. We've been watching soldiers near the border lately, and maybe they inadvertently invaded us?;;;;;;;;;;;X
FV_RUS;Savinkov's path to the top was rich: the January assassination, Kornilov's coup and alliance with him, the death of the General, the merging of the posts of PM and President. The Vozhd' immediately set to work: the unification of the lands torn from Russia. He, like no one else, is aware of the need for revenge on the Germans, and he has been preparing for retribution for several years. Hundreds of thousands were mobilized, intensified the activities of Russophiles in Europe, destabilizing torn pieces of the Russian state. The army is on high alert, the people are tempted by Savinkov's speeches to restore integrity. Fate itself told us when to attack: when the Kaiser died...;;;;;;;;;;;X
FV_V1_desc;The Russian army tried to instil fear in us by setting a dark darkness. The initial stage of the fighting was difficult, but after the regrouping we resolutely moved forward. The counterattack showed how ridiculous Savinkov's words were. The joint army of Mitteleuropa reached Moscow and Petrograd. The self-proclaimed Vozhd' is on his knees. Germany asserted its right to dominate Europe. Let us rejoice in Kaiser, who restored order!;;;;;;;;;;;X
FV_V2_desc;The Russian army tried to instil fear in us by setting a dark darkness. The initial stage of the fighting was difficult, and cost us many casualties. Given our capabilities, we retreated to organize a stronger line of defence. With the onset of winter, the front froze. We have escaped defeat, but we need time to recover. In addition, the reserves are approaching, like other divisions from the east. The following year, Mitteleurope's army went on the offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;X
FV_V3_desc;The Russians felt sorry for the loss of land, and when someone appeared who assured them of their return, people believed. The time has come for a modernized army to show the world what it is capable of. We struck blow after blow at the Germans, not letting them breathe. Thanks to this, we cleared our way to Berlin. Exhausting battles on the outskirts of the city only supported us, and the capital is ours! Kaiser and his family were taken prisoner, and a Russian flag was hoisted over the burning Reichstag. The Vozhd' is satisfied! Now Russia has the right to be called the hegemon of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;X
FV_V4_desc;The Russians felt sorry for the loss of land, and when someone appeared who assured them of their return, people believed. The time has come for a modernized army to show the world what it is capable of. In a few months we returned to the historical borders. The primary goal has been achieved, but we are at war with German-occupied Europe. Ahead is a long war, which can already be called liberation.;;;;;;;;;;;X
