DPERSONALITY_BIASED_ENGINEER_SOLDIER;While his parents strongly identified with the British Empire, McNaughton held to a form of Scottish-Canadian nationalistic identity while retaining high regard for the British people. A gifted engineer, at McGill University he earned a degree in physics and then electrical engineering in 1912. Joining the nonpermanent militia in 1909, McNaughton's scientific approach to gunnery principles during The Great War earned him accolades and promotions and he quickly became acting brigadier of the entire heavy artillery and counter-battery forces of the Canadian Corps in 1918. Rising to deputy chief of the general staff in 1922, his intense interest in new technology and of artillery, engineering and armour was marred by his neglect of modern infantry doctrine and new practical tactical realities.

After graduating from the Shikan Gakko, he would spend time as an observer within the Imperial Japanese Army before returning to Yunnan to serve as a teacher in the recently established Yunnan Military Academy. When word of the Wuchang Uprising reached Yunnan, Tang, along with his close friend and mentor Cai E, would quickly move to throw off Qing control over Yunnan. Tang's shot at fame would come in 1912 when Yunnanese units under his command intervened in favor of the Constitutionalist faction in Guizhou, with Tang being made its governor shortly after his takeover. Later he would return to Yunnan to assume governorship over his native province. A firm believer in the federalist cause, Tang struggled against both the Northern warlords and Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang government for Southern China. This culminated in a failed invasion of Guangxi in 1925 to link up with Chen Jiongming, the federalist governor of Guangdong. Having failed in his ventures to realise a southern confederation, combined with Yunnan's increasing destitution due to the failure of his federalist reforms, Tang would be forced to settle down and reorganise his province. Reluctantly accepting the Xuantong Restoration in the face of overwhelming Zhili military superiority, Tang Jiyao would retreat further into isolationism, turning Yunnan into a fortress of republicanism.

DPERSONALITY_CHEN_JIONGMING;Known far and wide as Southern China’s “Model Governor”, Chen Jiongming’s accomplishments during his tenure over Guangdong would seemingly merit him the title. Both a reformer and a revolutionary since early in his life, Chen was engaged in both legal and extralegal activities in order to realize his dream of a republican, democratic Chinese nation. He participated enthusiastically in the nascent Guangdong Provincial Assembly, gaining a reputation as an unresolving and incorruptible magistrate. Thus, Chen Jiongming naturally assumed a leading position in the Guangdong Army’s revolt against Qing authority in 1911, owing to his capability and reputation. His revolutionary networks and local support allowed Chen to consolidate the gains of the Xinhai Revolution in his home province, but the arrival of Sun Yat-sen would fracture the province between the two prominent men. This came to a head in 1922, as Chen and Sun’s supporters broke into open fighting. Chen would formally step down as governor of Guangdong naval forces under Sun’s order and bombarded Guangdong’s urban quarters. Their personal enmity would lead to a permanent divide between the federalist-oriented republicans and the more centralist Kuomintang.However, as Kuomintang units gradually faltered in their Northern Expedition against the Anguojun, Chen, with local support and some compromises with the newly-ascendant Sun Chuanfang, would rise to become Guangdong’s governor once again. What followed was a very delicate, yet effective process of reconstruction of Liangguang, devastated by more than a decade of strife and conflict. Despite the looming shadow of the Smiling Tiger and the ever-hungry German colonials eyeing Guangdong, Chen has also managed to ensure a degree of stability and economic independence in Guangdong, whilst also supporting his less fortunate federalist allies in Yunnan and Hunan.
