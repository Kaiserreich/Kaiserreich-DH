EVT_1090R_DESC;Last week we had the displeasure of disclosing certain suspect activities relating to a prominent figure in the Government. This week the minister concerned failed to make a public speech denying his involvement in the scandal. However, an expert reporter of one of the national radio stations managed to press the minister into more or less confessing that he has not only lied to the public about his involvement, but also that he has been lying in front of the High Court on several occasions. Our political specialists tell us that this most probably will force the Head of Government to re-shuffle his cabinet.;La semaine derni�re, nous vous avons r�v�l� certaines activit�s suspectes auxquelles s'�tait livr� un membre haut plac� du gouvernement Cette semaine, le ministre vis� s'est abstenu de nier les faits en question. Cependant un journaliste politique de l'une des stations de radio est parvenu � lui faire avouer qu'il avait non seulement menti au public mais �galement � la Haute Cour et ce, en plusieurs occasions. Nos sp�cialistes politiques pr�disent un remaniement de gouvernement rapide, suite � ce scandale sans pr�c�dent.;La scorsa settimana, abbiamo avuto la spiacevole sorpresa di scoprire certe attivit� sospette riguardo una figura di spicco del governo. Questa settimana, il ministro implicato, non � riuscito a fare un discorso pubblico per negare il suo coinvolgimento nello scandalo. Tuttavia, un cronista esperto di un'emittente radio nazionale, � riuscito a costringere il ministro a confessare pi� o meno che non solo avrebbe mentito al pubblico sul suo coinvolgimento, ma che lo avrebbe fatto anche davanti all'Alta Corte in diverse occasioni. I nostri esperti di politica ci hanno riferito che ci� molto probabilmente costringer� il capo del governo a riformare il gabinetto.;La semana pasada tuvimos el disgusto de informar de ciertas actividades sospechosas por parte de una figura prominente del gobierno. Esta semana, el ministro en cuesti�n no ha dado una conferencia para negar su implicaci�n en el esc�ndalo. Sin embargo, un experto reportero de una de las cadenas de radio nacionales consigui� presionar al ministro hasta que casi confes� que no s�lo le ha mentido al p�blico acerca de su implicaci�n, sino que tambi�n ha mentido en varias ocasiones ante el Tribunal Supremo. Nuestros especialistas en pol�tica nos dicen que lo m�s probable es que esto obligue al jefe de gobierno a remodelar su gabinete.;Letzte Woche hatten wir das Missvergn�gen bestimmte verd�chtige Aktivit�ten bekannt geben zu m�ssen, die in Zusammenhang mit einer prominenten Regierungsfigur stehen. Diese Woche hat der entsprechende Minister verfehlt, in einer �ffentlichen Rede seine Beteiligung an dem Skandal  zu leugnen. Allerdings hat ein erfahrener Reporter eines nationalen Radiosenders den Minister unter Druck gesetzt, mehr oder weniger zuzugeben, dass er nicht nur die �ffentlichkeit aufgrund seiner Beteiligung, sondern auch in mehreren Gelegenheiten das oberste Zivilgericht belogen h�tte. Unsere politischen Spezialisten teilen uns mit, das der Staatschef voraussichtlich sein Kabinett umstrukturieren wird.;W ostatnim tygodniu spotka� nas nieprzyjemny obowi�zek ujawnienia podejrzanych dzia�a� jednego z wa�niejszych cz�onk�w gabinetu.

9000037desc;War bonds are debt securities issued by a government for the purpose of financing military operations during times of war. War bonds generate capital for the government and make civilians feel involved in their national military. This system is also useful as a means of controlling inflation in such an overstimulated economy by removing money from circulation until hopefully after the war is concluded. At that point, the funds could be liquidated and serve as an stimulus to encourage consumer spending for the economy transitioning to peacetime activity. Exhortations to buy war bonds are often accompanied with appeals to patriotism and conscience. Government-issued war bonds tend to have a yield which is below market value and are often made available in a wide range of denominations to make them affordable to all citizens.;Les emprunts de guerre sont des titres de cr�ance �mis par un gouvernement dans le but de financer des op�rations militaires en temps de guerre. Les obligations de guerre g�n�rent un capital pour le gouvernement et font que les civils se sentent impliqu�s dans leurs forces arm�es nationales. Les appels pour acheter des obligations de guerre sont souvent accompagn�s d'appels au patriotisme et � la conscience des citoyens. �mises par un gouvernement, les obligations de guerre ont tendance � avoir un rendement qui est en dessous de la valeur du march� et sont souvent mis � disposition dans un large �ventail de d�nominations pour les rendre accessibles � tous les citoyens.;Le obbligazioni di guerra sono titoli di debito emessi da un governo per il finanziamento delle operazioni militari in tempo di guerra. obbligazioni di guerra generano un capitale per il governo e fa sentire i civili coinvolti nel lo sforzo bellico nazionale. Questo sistema � utile anche come strumento di controllo dell'inflazione in un'economia sovrastimolata, rimuovendo denaro dalla circolazione fino alla fine della guerra. A quel punto, i fondi potrebbero essere liquidati e servire come stimolo per incoraggiare la spesa dei consumatori, per la transizione all'economia di pace. Esortazioni a comprare obbligazioni di guerra sono spesso accompagnate da appelli al patriottismo e di coscienza. Le obbligazioni di guerra emesse dal governo tendono ad avere una resa che � al di sotto del valore di mercato e spesso sono rese disponibili in una vasta gamma di tagli per renderli accessibili a tutti i cittadini.;Los Bonos son deuda adquirida por el gobierno con el prop�sito de financiar operaciones militares durante el estado de Guerra. Los Bonos de Guerra generan capital para el gobierno y hacen a los ciudadanos sentirse involucrados en el esfuerzo de guerra. Este sistema tambi�n es �til para controlar la inflaci�n, como en una econom�a sobre-estimulada, al remover dinero de circulaci�n despu�s de concluirse la guerra. En ese punto los restantes son liquidados y sirven como est�mulo para favorecer el consumo como m�todo de reactivar la econom�a de preguerra. La propaganda de Bonos va acompa�ada casi siempre por consignas de patriotismo o conciencia y van divididos en varias denominaciones, lo que les hace estar al alcance del bolsillo de cualquier ciudadano.;Nationale Kriegsanleihen werden in Kriegszeiten von Regierungen aufgelegt, um die erh�hten Milit�rausgaben finanzieren zu k�nnen. Diese Anleihen bringen dem Staat zus�tzliches Geld ein und geben den B�rgern das Gef�hl, an den Kriegsanstrengungen beteiligt zu sein. Dieses System ist auch im Kampf gegen die Inflation in einer auf voller Kraft laufenden Wirtschaft n�tzlich, indem es grosse Geldbetr�ge aus dem W�rungskreislauf entfernt. Wenn nach Kriegsende die Anleihen zur�ckgezahlt werden, ist das zus�tzliche Kapital hilfreich, den privaten Konsum wieder anzukurbeln und damit der Wirtschaft die Umstellung auf die Friedensproduktion zu erleichtern. Aufrufe zum Kauf von Kriegsanleihen gehen meist einher mit Appellen an patriotische Gef�hle und das Gewissen der Bev�lkerung. Im allgemeinen liegt der Wert der staatlichen Kriegsanleihen unter dem aktuellen Marktwert und ist preislich so gestaffelt, da� praktisch jeder B�rger diese Anleihen auch erwerben kann. ;;;������� ��������� ������������ ����� �������� ������ ������, ���������� �������������� � ����� �������������� ������ �������� �� ����� �����. ������� ����� ���������� ������� ��� ������������� � ���� ����������� ����� �������� �������� � ������������ ����������� �����. ��� ����� ������� � �������� �������� ������ � ��������� � ������������������ ���������� ����� ����� ����� �� ��������� �� ��������� ��������� �����. ����� ��� �������� ����� ���� ��������� � ����� ������� �������� ��� ��������� ��������������� �������� ��� �������� � ������ ������������. ������� ����������� ������� ��������� �������� �������������� ���������� � ����������� � �������.;;;;X

EVT_TUCOPENED_DESC;The 1936 TUC Congress has been opened with much fanfare. This is the most important political event of the year, as it is now that new ministers are appointed and (although it is not explicitly mentioned) changes in Union policy are made and announced. This years congress will probably be a bit special though. Long-time TUC chairman Philip Snowden has long indicated that he intends to withdraw following this congress, and the stakes are high. Rivalling factions are forming behind the curtains, and the decentralizationist Authonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralizationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley), status quo socialist Federationists (Arthur Horner) and radical egalitarian paci-isolationist Congregationalists (Annie Kenney) are all wying for superiority in the TUC. Whatever the outcome, this will surely be a thing to remember...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT666701_DESC;After the Franco- German war of 1870 to 1871, the Sedantag was established in Germany to celebrate the 1870 victory in the battle of Sedan. Originally a holiday to honour the Prussian military, the Sedantag transformed under the reign of Wilhelm II into a day to celebrate the foundation of the German empire, and after the Weltkrieg the defeat of those forces that tried to destroy the Reich. Thoughout every town and village from Aachen to Memel, every street is decorated in black, white, and red. Every bell proudly proclaims this day of celebration. Nobilitiy, officers, soldiers, and unnumbered veterans parade proudly thought the streets, cheered by the happy masses. People sing patriotic songs, have pickniks with friends and family, play music, and dance around bonfires. Indeed, this is a good day, a day that reminds us of the peace and prosperity we have enjoyed since the german unification.;;;;;;;;;;x

Starting in Tahiti 36 hours ago, Fraulein Hoffmann today landed savely in Lae on German New Guinea, where she was welcomed by a jubilous crowd and governor Albert Hahl.

EVT_700600_DESC;These are violent and turbulent times we are all living in. There are many threats to the west, to the north and to the east that endanger the independence and sovereignty of us and our neighbours. To the east, Afghanistan, threatened by the eventual war in India that will spill over into their borders and Azerbaijan to the North, whose oil fields in Baku are vunerable and a large priority for the Ottomans and the Russians both.

EVT_700605_DESC;Since the beginning of the 19th century, the Qajar dynasty diminished in power by foreign influence and political infighting. The Constitutional Revolution of 1905 reformed the government to become a constitutional monarchy, but the country was still under domination by the British and Russian Empires, to the point where Persia was occupied in the Weltkrieg. Fortunately, both empires weakened dramatically during the final years of the war, and the Qajar have regained their spotlight as a regional power. After their long and taxing liberation from foreign occupation, the Persians were faced with internal turmoil. The Kurdish provinces revolted under Simko Shikak, leading to a large internal conflict that strained the country. Additionally, the socialist Jangali movement led by Mirza Kuchik Khan, resurfaced during the 20s and attacked the government in guerilla attacks. A huge political shift occurred after the death of Ahmad Shah Qajar, bringing the 8 year old Fereydoun Mirza Qajar into the spotlight, which lead to Mohammad Hassan Mirza Qajar becoming the regent of the empire. Combined with our backwater and uncompetitive economy, the country erupted into civil war in 1934 after all socialist parties were banned. After a year of fighting, a truce was established between the so called "Socialist Republic of Persia" and our Sublime State of Persia. Currently, the socialists occupy the northwestern part of our country, after annexing Kurdistan, and are receiving supplies from the Third Internationale through Azerbaijan. Despite this, their army is full of militia, and our professional army should easily defeat them. It's only a matter of time until this truce ends.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700606_DESC;Many meetings with the majlis, Qajar princes, and even the military took place in the discussions on how to rebuild our country back to its former glory. The most practical option is to throw money into the right industries and have our infrastructure fixed. However, the point of contention occurs on who should receive the funding for these projects. Our prime minister is an advocate in spending it to all sectors of the economy in the underdeveloped communities. Mohammed, on the other hand, suggests only key industries should receive it as they're more trusted with the government. Few have openly supported rapid development by the military.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700607_DESC;It's no secret that Mohammed is an ambitious prince that desires more power.  Rumours have spread that he even harbours ambitions for the throne! Some believe it as he continues to overrule some policies in the meetings. Outrage spreads from even the other princes as they believe that our shah is being coerced from him. Unfortunately, open discourse have been met with sceptical resignations, and thus resistance against him have been made secret. Whether this faction is successful in limiting the powers of Mohammed, but some prominent princes have made a hidden plot against him.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700608_DESC;Ignoring the advice of our hawk-minded generals, we have decided to continue with the peace meetings in true faith that mercy and righteousness are the path forward. Outside of the palace, a white dove was found holding a branch, which could be a sign from God that peace is within our reach. Providentially, the socialists agree, and we shall carry out a grand meeting between our diplomat Mirza Riza Arfa Dowleh, and their leader Mirza Kuchik Khan. Some anticipate that this meeting will be the one that ends the civil war.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700609_DESC;After two hours, both leaders were seen exiting from the government building to their respective sides. Information about the meeting is scarce, but it is confirmed that the results were unsuccessful. Mirza Khan would later state in his speech in Tehran "...the meeting has reinforced my values that the Jangali Movement is morally superior to the corrupt Qajar government, whose policies and demands are incompatible to the rights of the people." Both sides have started to reinforce on the borders and war awaits.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700610_DESC;Fereydoun is the youngest shah to ever inherit the throne at 8 years old, preceding even his father at 11 years old. He is 14 now, but it's still worrying to the people of Persia on whether he's ready for the responsibilities and the duties ahead as shah. It's not exactly known whether he was trained or has the mental capabilities of a ruler, but the next chain of events may change the fate of the world. His grandfather, Abdol-Hossein Farman, a prominent Qajar prince, invites the young shah to a long conversation about the future of Persia, and his feelings towards his uncle.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700611_DESC;"It's very important that you listen to me carefully Fereydoun. The fate of your empire is at stake here." Abdol-Hossein continues soft-spoken on the dire situation the state is placed in. Referencing that the end of the civil war is not the end of Persia's problems, but rather the beginning. One final question given to the shah was his request to be part of the plot that would bring down Mohammad Hassan Mirza, and replace his position of power. The young shah, troubled and resolute from this conversation, responded...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700612_DESC;During the meeting in the majlis, many insignificant issues were brought up and resolved within the first hour. It was until the prime minister himself, Mohammad Sa'ed, spoke of the bid to remove Mohammad Hassan Mirza from office, and replace the regent with Abdol-Hossein Farman. Stunned, Mohammed had barely any time to respond himself until the overwhelming majority of ministers voted in accordance to the bid. The indignant former-minister was thrown out of the majilis for disrupting the peace, and his political career is over.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700613_DESC;Despite the destruction that the civil war caused, much of the novels and films on the subject has caused the literary world to flourish with expressionism, exploring the dark side of human nature. Films such as Abdolhossein Sepanta's Black Eyes, focused on the horrors of war and the lengths that men with radical ideas would take, even at the cost of one's own sanity. Not all films are dark and gloomy, but such a cultural shift in Persia's art led to a unique era of film that explored the human psyche, where even foreigners have taken an interest in the films.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700614_DESC;One of our ministers, Ali-Akbar Davar, is a fine judge who came forth with a proposal to change the judicial system. It seems that according to him, our system has been modified over the past few decades to be more favorable to the Qajar family, to the point where even some of our princes have gotten away scott free from crimes that they should have been punished for. The proposal if passed would change much of the system to be equally fair for all people in Persia, including minorities. While there were some protests from the hardliners who believe that this change would lead to a domino effect of intense liberalization, the majority of the majlis have voted in favour for the proposal. Fereydoun Shah Qajar approved the proposal as well, stating that corrupt systems like these are what made people like his uncle have too much power and exploited the system. As news spread of this proposal being passed, many in and out of the country rejoiced as Persia is on its way to becoming a modernized country with a modern system.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700615_DESC;Fazlollah Zahedi is a relatively significant general and statesman of Persia.

He is known to be acquainted well with the field marshal Reza Khan, and has been politically active to earn himself the governorship of Isfahan, after failures to win in Khuzestan against Khaz'al Bin Jabir. While he was content with his position as governor, the new Mohammed Hassan Shah Qajar has threatened his power with replacing his political allies with those loyal to the Qajar family.

EVT_700616_DESC;On a dark night, in the basement of a bathhouse, Zahedi and Pahlavi are preparing for tomorrow's attack. Their loyal armies seem to be ready, and they will commence once Zahedi gives the orders on the radio. Both men toast to the success of the attack and to a new government. Just before they start to sip their vodka shots, a large rumbling sound can be heard overhead. Worried, Zahedi and Pahlavi grab their lugers and hid behind the furniture. Coming from the top of the basement stairs, a voice called out. "You are surrounded, surrender now and prepare to be arrested!" "No!" replied Pahlavi, "If you want to take us alive, come and get us!"" Both men had a frightened appearance, for they knew that this would be the last moments of their lives. "Suit yourselves." A click was heard, and something was thrown onto the floor. A grenade! The two fell and took cover, preparing for the blast. Surprisingly, there was none, and they believed it was a dud. Both poised over the furniture only to see six soldiers aiming for them. "Fire!" said the commander, and the lives of two generals were lost.;;;;;;;;;;x

A decadent assortment of flatbread with feta cheese, jam, honey, and a hot bowl of Halim, along with Persian tea, it was a very comforting time for the shah during this turbulent time. Suddenly, sounds of doors being flinged open and rumbling of soldiers, the shah was confronted by Karim Buzarjomehri and a multitude of soldiers that grabbed hold of servants and family members. Karim reads out a parchment, "Mohammed Hassan Mirza Qajar, you must abdicate your throne or suffer the highest punishment our military will offer." The Shah barked at the idea, and continued to eat his breakfast. Karim looked over his shoulder and nodded. An overeager soldier pointed his rifle and shot the Shah in the chest, killing the man in a matter of seconds.;;;;;;;;;;x

It is through my ascension of power that our empire thrives today! And there are some who wish to take me down. These some, these greedy ticks, are none other than the people who bear the Qajar blood. They wish to bring back the corruption, the humiliation, that our empire once deteriorated under their rule. No longer! My dynasty shall reign for a thousand years, with my generations keeping our empire on the top! It is time, I tell you all, that the Qajar ticks be rid from our empire.

A lavish ceremony filled with decadent food, dazzling aristocrats, and delightful music, the reporters say it is one of the most glamorous commemorations of the Zahedi dynasty. With prominent people dancing under the moon, and the world focusing on the beautiful ceremony, the operation is set to go. Thousands of soldiers dressed in grey uniforms barge into residences of Qajar princes. In their wake, the soldiers seized each Qajar kin and servant, binding them, and dragging them into trucks, where they're sent outside of their cities. Through their respective sites, large dug-up trenches awaited them. Some started to sob uncontrollably, others stared in shock as they knew what was going to happen. As the princes have been lined up in front, they prayed to god, with each prayer louder than the other. The trench awaited them, as the grey soldiers aimed and shot the people in rows.

EVT_700620_DESC;Persia is a country in Central Asia that was ruled by successions of brutal empires, the latest one being ruled by the corrupt Qajar Empire. The aristocracy has always exploited the poor and the meek in our lands, and the Qajar family has been the richest family in the world thanks to their corruption. Fortunately, in a time of ideologies and self-determination, empires in the modern age are weakening. This was seen with the British empire falling, first from their loss in the weltkrieg, and second in their revolution in the mainland. Persia is in a no better position, with much of the same issues displaying during the 1920s. It is through their weakness that the Jangali movement, led by Mitzi Kuchik Khan, has grown stronger and became a powerful tide in the geopolitics of Central Asia. It wasn't until the ban on socialist parties that the Jangali movement took action. Mirza Kuchik Khan, and his allies seized the chance by taking over Rasht with his loyal militia supplied by the Third Internationale. The takeover was bloodless and quick, and the liberation army kept moving forward towards the rest of the Gilam region, with the grand prize being the capital, Teheran. The insurgency was risky, however everything escalated when the Kurds, Azeris, and the Armenians joined our cause. This sudden turn of events was thanks to Mirza Khan, as his charisma and dedication to his ideas made him a safer option than being loyal to the Qajar. The movement was quick, and Teheran was within reach. Many rich people, including the Qajar family, fled from Teheran, to avoid being in the crossfire. The city was scarcely defended, only a few garrison troops from the Persian Cossack brigade. With the night of the liberation army, the siege of Teheran was swift and the garrisons surrendered. This turning point of the civil war became news worldwide, and brought shock to the rest of the country. The Persian empire decided to respond with immediate conscription and bringing the rest of their army to the frontlines. Our progress was halted by the mountains, but our cause is still held high, as the enemy reached a stalemate. Throughout this year, the frontlines barely shifted, but the casualties, refugees, and POWs exponentially rose for both sides, leading to a truce in late 1935 to solve these issues. The civil war shall continue, for the revolution never stops.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700621_DESC;Out of nowhere, a lone white dove has landed in the middle of town square, holding an olive branch. Reports from the enemy have also made similar discoveries. This significant event can only mean that God wants peace and reconciliation. Mirza Kuchik Khan and Reza Radmanesh discussed on the off-chance negotiations do occur, what will they demand? After long hours, it has come to this. The socialist party ban in Persia must be uplifted, and the Jangali movement must have some influence in the government. Both do not expect that the Qajar family will ever comply to this request, but it would at least allow more of the Persian population to understand that the Jangali Movement is a movement for the people, and that it wants to help the people primarily.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700622_DESC;The 1935 Truce has been most helpful so far. We have received most of our prisoners of war that have come back to our fold, and the displaced refugees have found shelter in our borders. However, its very likely that the Qajar menace will start attacking at any moment, and thus we must prepare. Fortunately, the Third Internationale has been in contact with us, and have been supplying our armies through the caucuses. While they're wary of Mirza Kuchik Khan and his radical views on socialism, they're inclined to send us more troops if we can promise them that we would follow the principles of socialism that trust.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700623_DESC;After everything settled down, the majlis zakat met together to discuss the establishment of the constitution. Many drafts were proposed, including one from Mirza Khan himself, but with so many conflicting opinions and ideas, there was never an agreed final draft. The majlis zakat have formed a basic draft that fit most of the framework as a republic, but a key few points have yet to be agreed upon: religion, economy, and land reform. The main two factions emerged from this dispute, ones who support Mirza Kuchik Khan, and ones, regarded as "westerners" who believe in replicating the same policies as in the west. This constitution of the socialist republic will determine the path of socialism in Central Asia.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700624_DESC;Religion has been an important issue in the socialist world. Almost everyone agrees with removing the religious influence in government. However, the status of religion itself in socialist countries have be highly debated. Mirza Kuchik Khan is an ardent advocate of Islamic socialism, and believes that Islam itself has core concepts that would be regarded as socialist. One of the pillars of Islam, Zakat, roughly means the welfare for others, and requires every Muslim to give charity to those who are poor. Mirza believes that by emphasising this pillar of Islam, the Islamic world would become more compatible with the socialist ideology. The westerners, on the other hand, wish to downplay Islam altogether, and educate the population to regard religion as superstition. They hope to transform the culture into one that is syndicalist-oriented, and fade the past teachings into obscurity. The debates are serious, and through the vote, the outcome is..;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700625_DESC;Most socialist states currently are founded in industrious countries, but Persia is different. Because of the lack of modernisation during the past decades, Persia is still largely an agrarian country. All agree that Persia needs to have an industry, but the focus on the grand scheme of the economy varies. For Mirza, embracing the agrarian economy of the country is a sure fire way to empower the masses and bring equality to the peasantry. The westerners believe that Persia needs rapid development through industrialisation, as the socialist republic is surrounded by enemies who will combine forces and bring down the republic. Additionally, they believe that this will help replicate the success of the revolution as it did in France and Britain. The debates are serious, and through the vote, the outcome is..;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700626_DESC;The last topic of the debate is the one that creates the most heat. Despite land reform being the major process of creating a socialist republic, Mirza Kuchik Khan never implemented it and doesn't look like he has plans to. His loyalists state that while a revolution is a revolution, much of the landowners are in support of our republic, and to implement land reform would very likely anger these supporters and cause havoc to our already unstable situation. The westerners, shocked by this reasoning, believe no socialist must submit to anything but the ideals of socialism. In addition, the internationale observers are to be believed that this core idea would be the defining factor for support or sanctions from the internationale. It's late, everyone's tired, but the vote leads to a result of..;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700627_DESC;Despite the leader's goodwill and dedication to his cause for socialism, his power is no longer stable. In just a few days after the last majlis zakat, militia members stormed into the building seeking to arrest Mirza Kuchik Khan. In the ensuing chaos, Mirza was in the wrong place and got shot accidentally in left temple of his brain. After quick action blocking the bleed and resuscitating the leader, Mirza miraculously survives! Unfortunately he lost all mental capabilities and is incapable to lead. With no one to replace Mirza, the westerners take power under Reza Radmanesh, reverting the constitution to please the internationale.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700628_NAME;The Persian Five Year Plan;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700628_DESC;Once a cradle of the sciences, Persia was involuntarily pulled into a period of ignorance and obsolescence by its feudal rulers. Centuries of isolationism and closing off weakened the once advanced Persian people. Feudalism hampered economic development while the Shahs adamantly refused to allow new sciences and discoveries to enter the nation, fearing foreign domination. It was not until when British and Russian Empires came down upon them did the imperials made any attempts at modernization, though in doing so they became puppets of the imperialists themselves. If we are to remain in the hills and pray for socialism from Allah, we will inevitably share their fate. Our top economists and industrialists have devised a list of five-year plans, all intended to help rapidly increase our industrial production.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700629_NAME;The Land Reforms Rexamined;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700629_DESC;The Internationale's role in saving our revolution from the esoteric form of socialism that the Jangalis had been preaching can not be underestimated. Had Kuchik Khan and his clique of clergymen and landowners been allowed to run the country, the situation for the people would not be much different from their times under the Shah.  The elites and sheiks would continue to run the country while the peasantry continues to toil away, ignorant of their rights to their lands. Recent reports have shown that the Jangalis might have hindered the land redistribution program on purpose. Many land sectors still remain the same while in others, farmers receive the bare minimum to start cultivating their crops. We must amend this travesty as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700630_NAME;Addressing the brain drain and the intelligentsia;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700630_DESC;The extensive brain drain across the country after the civil war's end was undoubtedly caused by many in the intelligentsia class fleeing due to fear of repression. Though many disregard these professionals as reactionaries and capitalists, they are still are a much-needed force in Persia's march towards modernity. Some have proposed that we loosen  on intellectual and press restrictions, while others say that it would be better if a new generation of civil servants can be trained on our term, free from foreign influence;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700631_NAME;The Tribal Families of Persia;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700631_DESC;The tribesmen have been roaming Persian soil for more than a millennia now. They're mostly composed of Kurdish communities near the Mesopotamian border, Pashtuns, Qashqais, Bakhtiari, and even some Arab tribes in Khuzestan. Control over them is loose at best and most of the time non-existent due to their nomadic nature, making it hard to maintain our records. Another difficulty in dealing with them, ironically, is their organizational ability. Most of the tribes are centrally managed by strong and powerful chieftains, though there are some differences between the powerful, centralized tribal chiefdoms of our western province with their broad pastoral bases and the independent, hardy, egalitarian Pashtun mountain villagers near the eastern borderlands with Afghanistan. During the civil war, many did take up arms against both our government and the enemy's, though the majority avoids any fighting if possible. One thing is undeniable, however, in order to advance Persia forward, we must find a way to negotiate with these chiefs, for they hold much political sway over their respective population and controls vital resources and key points throughout the country;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700632_DESC;During the war, we were able to send in many infiltrators within the Imperial Army's ranks. They proved themselves to be an invaluable asset for the revolution by informing us of the Shah's military formation and plans, which helped to greatly shorten the war. After the war, most members returned to ordinary intelligence service. However, as tensions begin to mount between us and the opposition, some in the cabinet have suggested that we restart the network's internal operations. As there still exists many Jangali loyalists within our army, combined with the populist rallies of Mossadegh, which can become dangerous elements if not carefully monitored and kept under control.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700633_NAME;The Coal of Persia;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700633_DESC;European surveys throughout the mid-19th century reported coal deposits throughout the country. Azerbaijan, Zanjan, Mazandaran, Gilan, Kasan, and Kerman were all listed as coal-rich provinces, with some even possessing so much coal that they openly on the surfaces. However, these mines were mostly untapped due to lack of demand, as Persia did not have a large enough industrial base at that time to warrant expanding these mines. Now that we are pursuing industrialization, new collieries will be needed to fuel our new factories.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700634_NAME;The National Iranian Steel Committee;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700634_DESC;The first proposals for construction steel mills and smelting plants in Persia were complete in 1928 after much debating between the Majles and Krupp. However, the chaos after the collapse of the British Empire and technical difficulties halted the plan's realization. Now that circumstances have stabilized and interest in industrialization is at an all-time high, a group of industrialists and mining technicians has asked for our blessing in forming a national council to be put in charge of steel production and extraction. Promising to restart many shelved programs and start new mining operations, the committee's representative has asked for significant funding to kickstart their schemes.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700635_NAME;Adressing the Maktab System;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700635_DESC;The Maktab or maktab-kana, meaning 'place of writing' was the primary system used to educate children in recent Persian history. The Maktabdar or teachers taught children in wealthy families with commoners children being allowed to join in if the household permits them. The curriculum of these classes placed heavy emphasis on religious studies and traditional literature with little attention to the sciences or mathematics. Female students were also discouraged and often blocked from pursuing higher education. As a result, the 'graduates' that these institutions produced were not suitable to serve in any jobs that required any technical knowledge, with most of them choosing to become maktabdars themselves. The Ministry of Education has suggested reigning in these schools due to them hindering literacy rates and providing less than adequate education for the modern age. However, the Shia clergy will protest any interference into these groups because their influence rely heavily on these religious educators.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700636_DESC;Earlier efforts to build factories in Persia all ended disastrously. The high costs of importing machines, religious opposition to factory-building, and a shortage of essential material like coal and iron were just a few in a long list of obstacles that plagued the attempts to bring the industrial revolution to our country. However, what we consider to be the most detrimental restriction is the lack of electricity. The power grid's extent only goes as far as large cities like Tehran and Tabriz, which hinder commercial activity and productivity in provinces without major urban centers. Modern enterprises like mining and manufacturing and even traditional trades like textile would benefit considerably from being able to operate modern machinery in the resource-rich provinces instead of having to transport them to major cities. In addition, electrifying remote provinces would help better the living conditions of many.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700637_NAME;The Cotton of Persia;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700637_DESC;Cotton has played an important in the history of Persia. Aside from its obvious uses as cosmetic material, with our famed rugs being a notable example, the Persian people utilize almost every part of the plant in their daily life. Cotton and textile accounted for a sizeable portion of Persia's foreign capital income, with annual production reaching nearly 20.000 tons in 1925. The British retreat and outbreak of civil war caused cotton growth to cease and drop to only half of what it was before the Raj's collapse. Though we can let this vital industry recover on its own, it would be wise to invest in the mechanization of both cotton growth and processing, which would profit us in the long term.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700638_NAME;The Revolutionary Army of Persia;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700638_DESC;We inherited the Persian Revolutionary Army directly from Mirza Khan's Jangalis. While they have shown their efficacy in guerilla fighting, the same cannot be said about their performance when facing the Imperial Army in conventional warfare. The Internationale reacted to this by sending over advisors and volunteers to help support the liberation of Persia. However, the advisors' pleadings for Mirza Khan to reorganize the revolutionary guards fell on deaf ears. We will not be as stubborn or senseless. A modern army is necessary to secure the revolution in a region dominated by feudalists and imperialists. The Internationale advisors await our approval of their plans if they are to remain and support our Republic. The Jangalis, on the other hand, are protesting any changes outside of codifying military laws and some small adjustments. While we can ignore their foolish ramblings, the grassroots influence they hold within the military still concerns some in our administration. They call for a gradual transition to modern standards instead of an instant shift to a western service model, which would avoid upsetting too much of the armed forces.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700641_DESC;The Deutsch-Persische �lgesellschaft still controls the drilling complexes and refineries that rightfully belong to us in the South. Though nationalizing these wells would provide us with a budget big enough to modernize Persia within a decade, we do not have the means to directly confront Germany with its vast dominions and fleets right now. For now, we will have to make do with the funds we have to bring Persia into the modern age, which is why Mossadegh has introduced to the Majles his      'Plan Organization'. Designed to help manage budget shortfalls and restrictions before we can regain the oil wells, their ultimate goal is to help our economy transition to an oil-free phase once we've finished the modernizations that are possible only with the revenue from the DP�.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700642_NAME;The Bazaar Bargain;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700642_DESC;Our trade networks quickly crumbled after the onset of civil war, striking a lethal blow to the already weak economy. This lead to a mass exodus of merchants and financiers, which meant that we faced many hurdles throughout the reconstruction period without their financial expertise. The previous administration attempted to relieve this by strengthening its grip on the economy and trade, both domestic and foreign. What little progress they've made on recovery is overshadowed by many more bungles, further crippling the Persian economy because of their pretentious attitude in thinking that bureaucrats can replace thousands of years old business ties. No, Premier Mossadegh understands better than civil servants that the merchants will do their job better than any specialists can. During the Weltkrieg, they've supplied and fed the nation well enough. Now he will call on them to serve Persia once again;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700643_NAME;Taxes,taxes...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700643_DESC;Taxation in Persia has always been a headache for those who are at the end of the line. The mayors, tribal chiefs, provincial governors all participated in embezzling the limited tax that we can collect, not to mention the British 'Tax Advisors' that proved to be little more than pretentious leeches. During his tenure as Minister of Finance for the Qajar government, Mossadegh had tried to combat these issues, though his bills were struck down the Majles at that time. Not only would tax collection be reformed through the public oversight committee, but the public would also be able to see what their money is spent on through the expenditure committee. Now elected Premier of the Republic, Mossadegh can attempt to reintroduce these proposals.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700644_DESC;A formal public welfare system still does not exist in Persia. While some unions grant pensions, they are still rare and ineffective.The little social welfare we offered is exclusive to industrial workers and bureaucrats, which has led many to denounce our government as elitist and uncaring. The Jangali-Moderates are leveraging this discontent by setting up Zakat offices to provide unofficial insurance to the poor while preaching Islamic Socialism at the same time. Premier Mossadegh plans to retaliate against this cheap move by revamping the Workers' Insurance Organization into the Social Insurance Organization, which will include most of the general population in its insurance program. Not only will this help with popularity, but it will also prevent the people from being tempted back into the bosom of the Grand Ayatollah.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700645_NAME;The Shia Divide;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700645_DESC;Many imams and ulama rallied behind our side during the civil war because Mirza Khan tries his best to include the clergy within his administration and safeguard Islam. However, the adoption of the Western Constitution meant that crackdowns on religion began to happen. Further disturbing reports include the prosecution of imams in secular courts for 'counter-revolutionary' activities. While it is true that many did side with the royalists during the war, their motives for doing so were perfectly rational. Modarres himself did not participate in either's governments until the war had been decided.

EVT_700646_DESC;As one of the Five Pillars of Islam, zakat is a religious duty for all Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth. Although the Western-aligned factions try to argue that Islam in its current form is incompatible with Socialism, their words will become meaningless once we uplift millions of Persians from poverty through our Zakat chapters. Not only will this provide support for the needy, but will also show that a revolution needs no killing or class warfare, as all of Persian society will advance into the future, hand in hand.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700647_DESC;In the initial days, many wanted to immediately march forward and destroy the empire once and for all. However, the circumstances then were not suitable for a major offensive without risking disorganization and anarchy. Therefore, Mirza Khan decided to ask for a ceasefire to consolidate our initial gains. What followed was a series of public work projects initiated to promote growth. Schools, hospitals, factories were propped up all across Gilan and Persian Azerbaijan, helping to win us support amongst the peasantry and middle class. Gilan was the shining example of these projects, especially with its new irrigation projects helping to increase crop yield. Judicial and law enforcement reforms also greatly benefited workers and farmers, who only did not have access to fair and equitable courts before. So successful were these reforms that many began to doubt the reports we gave, questioning how a ragtag group of insurgents can surpass the old administration in infrastructure and modernization. Now that we've established ourselves to be the legitimate regime, initiating these reforms in the newly-liberated provinces will help dispel any rumors of staged prosperity or false reports.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700648_DESC;The Islamic Union is the name of a group founded by Persian nationalists and clergy during Weltkrieg and the invasion of Persia by Russia, Britain, and the Ottomans. Its stated goal was to unify all Muslim nations under the banner of the 'Islamic Union'. Originally, the board was based in Constantinople, though its differences with the Sunni Sultan led to the organization's relocation back to Iran. There, it came into contact with Mirza Kuchik Khan's Jangalis and helped him formulate a coherent ideology and resist the pull of Bolshevism. The Board was Kuchik Khan's disciplinary sword,helping to strengthen the Jangali movement through combatting corruption and preaching unity among the believers of Allah. Though its role was greatly diminished following the adoption of the Western Constitution,we can now restart the board's activities,this time on a national level.;;;;;;;;;;x

Unable to ignore the suffering of his fellow countrymen,Mirza Kuchik Khan personally ordered food aid to be sent south,helping to save the lives of many. The agriculture reforms by the Jangalis enabled this by producing a great surplus of food and the Islamic Union's fervent campaign against grain hoarding. A similar program could be drawn up for the South, where many farmers and peasants are still suffering from the aftermath of the civil war.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700650_NAME;The Constitutional Dilemma;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700650_DESC;Through threats of sanction and employing their Bolshevik lackeys in the Tudeh, they bullied the provisional committee into voting for their vision of our constitution. While some celebrate this as another step towards modernity for Persia, any true patriot would revolt at this display of foreign interference, no different from the proposed 1919 treaty that would have turned Persia into a British protectorate. Furthermore, this constitution was approved not by the will of the people, but a close-off committee whose chairman retired immediately after its approval. Inevitably, this led to many demands for a re-writing of the constitution, this time free from the meddling of the west. However, Haydar Khan Amo-oghli and the Tudeh have made clear their intentions to oppose any changes whatsoever to the constitution and will resort to drastic measures if we, quote-unquote 'Endanger the foundations of the Persian Socialist Revolution'.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700653_DESC;The Internationale's attempt to initiate land redistribution was disastrous for agricultural production. The peasantry, unfamiliar with government bureaucrats and the new structures imposed upon them, resisted any change and stuck with their landlord. This led to the transient administration to apply force in their distribution programs, which lead to an inefficient system of collective farms. This absurd class war between the old and new eventually takes its toll on the Persian people. Food shortage became a common sight in some areas, with some telling a now-infamous story of new 'Jangali' groups that kidnapped civilians and loot vulnerable villages. It is clear that these reforms are not working, and a rework is necessary. The Moderate Socialists are pushing for a complete reversion to the pre-constitutional era of land distribution, while their coalition partners prefer to retain some changes, especially concerning middle-class farmers and poor peasants.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700654_DESC;The industrialization efforts by the provisional government can be described, at best, as lackluster. Their over-confidence in heavy industries meant that much funding went towards building inefficient factories that lack workers or demand. Furthermore, many factories operate for only short periods, sometimes mere weeks before closing down due to a shortage of raw material and over-construction. Meanwhile, the peasantry and traditional tradesmen reel from the war's aftermath, receiving only trinket help from the transitional administration.

It is clear that well-intentioned or not, the Internationale has overstayed its welcome in Persia, and as it seems, now consider themselves more as the puppetmaster than a revolutionary partner.

EVT_700658_DESC;Many liberals had sided with the Shah during the civil war, which forbids them from participation in political activities in our new Republic. As a result, some regions and provinces have increasingly low turnout rates due to popular candidates being barred from holding office. We must reconsider this amendment, as many view it as an unjust obstruction of the democratic process. However, the Tudeh Party and Haydar Khan have warned against this, as they say 'by allowing counter-revolutionary elements to freely organize, we will have violated our constitutional authority'.Which may lead to their utilization of 'radical solutions' to prevent the fall of the Persian Revolution. ;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700659_DESC;The Armed Forces of the Socialist Republic remains highly politicized in nature. High Command and the old guard officers are mostly Jangali, while up-and-coming cadets enthusiastically take up Tudeh propaganda. The ones that disturb us the most are Haydar Khan's sleeper agents, who do his bidding efficiently and mercilessly. The polarized nature of the Majles has also found its way into the military, meaning that infighting occurs almost daily on the grounds of petty political arguments. Premier Mossadegh has expressed concern about this and the growing factionalism that is being encouraged by groups like the New Jangali Corps or the Tudeh Military Network. He feels that the army must place its duty to the people and their elected representatives first before their own political stance.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700660_DESC;The Trans-Persian Railway was a plan by the Entente for a large buildup of railways across Persia. First conceived by Russian businessmen, it took decades of negotiations before a Soci�t� d'Etudes representing the unified interests of the Entente can help start the project. This meant that only small portions of the network were complete by the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. The subsequent defeat and collapse of the Entente powers meant that construction came to a halt. The fighting during the civil war further devastates what little rails there were. But now, as we've firmly established ourselves as the rightful government, it would be wise to look back on some of these plans for any future constructions.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700662_DESC;The Republic's situation is still very uncertain, surrounded by reactionary powers and plagued internally by religious zealots and kulaks. Meanwhile, the Republican Army grows arrogant from its victory over the Qajar Dynasty. The officers rest on their laurels, content with keeping Persia passive while counter-revolutionaries plot in the dark. Furthermore, the General Staff refuse to consider or plan out the Generalissimo's Grand Eastern Revolution. Therefore, some have proposed we expand the Vanguards from its role as a party security force to a more official military branch. Doing this will help provide the Vanguards with the resources they need to plan out these operations, as well as extend their 'revolutionary missions'.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_700663_NAME;Re-examining the Land Reforms;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_700663_DESC;The Internationale's attempt to initiate land redistribution was disastrous for agricultural production. The peasantry, unfamiliar with government bureaucrats and the new structures imposed upon them, resisted any change and stuck with their landlord. This led to the transient administration to apply force in their distribution programs, creating an inefficient system of collective farms. However,that is not to say that the landed gentry were the breadbasket of the Persian nation,either. Their reluctance to modernize and adapt to new methods and changes were sometimes disastrous,as crop failures were wide-spread during the civil war, almost leading to a famine. Premier Mossadegh's new bill aim to walk between these extremes,introducing labour reforms and land reforms while not destroying the system overnight and giving peasants and farmers greater autonomy, instead of having bureaucrats and officials manage them in communes and collective farms.;;;;;;;;;;x

The traditionalist wing argued that because the Hashemites had collaborated with the secularist Egyptians,they had betrayed Islam in favour of tribalism,therefore unworthy to be Caliph.

The Emergency meeting by members of the Islamic Union was one filled with confusion and shock,as none had expect Turkestan to make such a move,much less seek recognition from us.

Though we'd have to compromised with the Jangalis on some core principles, Kuchik Khan's endorsement will secure the legitimacy of the new constitution.

Initially, the provisional government consisted of non-partisan civilians, with Harold Nicolson as acting Prime Minister and relatives of King Edward VIII as the service ministers.

EVT_830200_DESC;With the King in Buckingham Palace overseeing the restoration of Royalist rule in Britain, the question has arisen regarding the King's role in Canada.  During the Exile, the post of Governor-General lapsed and both George V and Edward VIII took his place directly in the structure of the Canadian government.  With the attention of Edward VIII focussed on Britain, the Canadian government has quietly suggested that the post of Governor-General should be revived, though of course this in no way diminishes the loyalty of the Dominion to His Majesty.  One suggestion has been to appoint the King's brother Albert as a permanent Governor-General.  Alternatively, the old practice of appointing Britons to the post could be revived.  Though such a decision might not be favourably received in Canada, General Brooke-Popham's name has been mentioned for the post.  On the other hand, the choice could be left to the Canadian government, in recognition of their vital role in the defeat of the Union of Britain.

The central activities of the day occur in the Imperial capital where, on the anniversary of his death, the remains of George V are reinterred in a special vault in an elaborate ceremony at Westminster Abbey, attended by Edward VII, the royal family, and leading political and military figures.  This fulfilled the late King's dying wish to return to Britain.  After the ceremony, the King led a solemn procession to the east end of the Mall, where a monument to George V was unveiled.  During the unveiling, the King stated that the monument commemorated all those who had been victims of the former Syndicalist regime, and that all had suffered, from the King to the lowest labourer.  Never again, pledged the King, would Syndicalism threaten the liberties of Englishmen, which had been passed down through the ages.

The National argument was that the independence of Ireland represented the first stage in the disintegration of the Empire, a prediction that subsequent events have apparently borne out.

The Federationists, however, propose a compromise - a socialist Canada incorporating all of the land north of the American border.

EVT_972602_DESC;Built as a display hall for the Great Exhibition of 1851, the Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass marvel of the old British Empire. During the Weltkrieg, it was transformed into the Royal Navy training station HMS Victory VI.

The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. Now that it has been decided that the city will host the Second Congress of the Syndicalist International next year, a proposal have been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies.

In Caribbean policy there are three major parties. The strongest and actually leading is Liberal Party of the Caribbean, created by mixed leaders of market- and social liberals. Her lider is charismatic Francis Stanley Jackson who cooperates with Gordon Lethem and Amy Bailey. This party favourizes freedom of speaking and free market. Patriotic Union Party is most reactionist and authoritarian party, leaded by Frederick Stubbs and Frederick Derecourt. This party supports idea of strong presidental rule and return to tradition. This party is divided on two factions: Stubbs' 'democrats', which share some ideas of Liberals, second faction is Derecourt's 'reactionists', who are nearly authoritarian with almost total control of state. Cipriani's Caribbean Social Democratic Party is the most leftist legal group. It has common view on the market with syndicalists or even Totalists, but supports large democratisation of the Federation. This party is led by Athur Andrew Cipriani.

EVT_91814_DESC;During this time of great crisis, the agricultural sector of German economy is one of the most vunerable to turmoil. With this in mind, several junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and subsidies to their production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strenghten this important sector of the Reich's economy. Such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, however, as they are greatly dependant in trade with Germany. The wheat crops in the Ukraine are particularly vulnerable.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_91815_DESC;Central Asia was a part of the Russian Empire once, but now it's out of our sphere of influence, which we cannot accept because of stability and safety of our borderline. Central Asian tribes will never be stable and calm - unless we force them to pacify. Alash Orda betrayed our good relationships and turned separatist, while Emir of Turkestan forgot that he was a Russian vassal before the Revolution - he transformed former Russian client state into the bastion of Islamist fanatics.

EVT_91816_DESC;With our recent occupation of Ireland, the government is split on whether to keep island under militar occupation for a certain time or to offer it independence under Prince Joachim, whom Michael Collins briefly asked to become King Brian III of Ireland in 1922. Those in favour of independence say that we would do best to avoid the quagmire of Irish nationalist fervour against occupation, while those against it say Ireland would serve as a very useful base for Atlantic shipping. There is also some controversy over Joachim's mental state since his alleged suicide attempt in 1923.;;;;;;;;;;x

Our glorious Tsar took this opportunity to cement relations between the British and Russian Empires, paving the way for peace and stability from the chaos and anarchy that so nearly destroyed us after the Weltkrieg.  The Tsar personally met Edward VII and promised both economic and military support to the British Empire through these times of recovery.  It is also noted that both the leaders agreed, that all the pain both nations suffered is the Germans fault, and rumours persist of war plans against the Germans to reclaim their rightful lands...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_1_DESC;The Guominjun-Fengtian coalition has managed to repel the German invaders and their unpatriotic lapdogs of the Kuonmintang in their feeble attempt to destroy the republican movement in China and forcebly restore Pu-Yi as a puppet emperor. After many months of fighting, victory and future of China lies in our hands !;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_2_DESC;Even though the Guominjun-Fengtian coalition has managed to stop the KMT advance from their strongholds in southern China, KMT and their German masters haven't been completelly expelled from China. Instead, they have simply retreated back to their position prior to the conflict. Even if we can claim a partial victory, the enemy could still be simply awaiting a chance to regroup, lick their wounds and initiate a new counter-attack in the future.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_3_DESC;Today is a great day for the Reich, as our Chinese allies. Kuomintang have succesfully completed their unification of China. After the defeat of a series of warlord cliques, KMT troops have entered the Forbidden City of Peking and reinstalled Emperor Pu-Yi to his rightfull throne, thus restoring the Qing Empire. The German Intervention in China is thus complete: we have stabilized a great portion of East Asia and gained a valuable ally for our New Order.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_4_DESC;The German Intervention in China has come to an end, but not as we have expected. Even though our forces, combined with our allies in the Kuonmintang, have managed to defeat the republican clique of the Guonminjun, the Fengtian warlords of Manchuria have resisted all our offensives, to the point of being recognized as a legitimate government of China by the Japanese Empire. The greater risk of an escalation of the conflict, combined with general unrest at home over this lenghty war, have pushed the Reich to armistice talks. The restoration of the German-backed Qing Empire has been recognized, as well as the independence of the Fengtien Republic, sponsored by the Japanese. In due time, however, this status-quo will be broken, and Germany and Japan will eventually face each other in a final war for mastery over the Eastern Asia...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_5_DESC;The seeds for Germany�s intervention in China are planted at the Siege of Wuchang, the last standing of Wuhan�s three neighboring cities. The continued survival of the city's garrison is a thorn in Chiang Kai-shek's side. He had counted on a swift victory, and the significance of Wuchang as the birthplace of the Xinhai revolution could have made its conquest the perfect propaganda platform. When Chiang delivers an ultimatum to the powers demanding that they withdraw their gunboats from the area, most decide on a policy of passive defiance, but Germany goes a step further. Its gunboats begin supplying the Wuchang garrison with badly needed food under the pretense of delivering "postage". The guise is poor, but this doesn't matter. Germany now has a basis to escalate the conflict, and has called Chiang's bluff. Further escalation would risk further German intervention, but Chiang gambles that this is the extent of German commitment, and that he can achieve the victory he needs elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_6_DESC;With the capture of the Kuomintang's provisional capital, and denied any major propaganda victory, talk of desertion begins to spread throughout the ranks of the NRA forces in Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong. Once scattered reports begin to arrive from Chiang's retreating forces in the east, this only worsens, and chaos ensues as various units defect, desert, or outright disintegrate. Chiang Kai-shek is held personally responsible for the army's failures, and soon meets assassination by a subordinate in revenge for his earlier elimination of competing conservative ideologue Hu Hanmin.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_7_DESC;In a glorious campaign, the united warlord forces, joined by their German allies, have completely destroyed the Kuomintang strongholds in the southern parts of the country and disintegrated the National Revolutionary Army completely. The Liangguang region has fallen under Nanjing control, and the Zhili clique have grown stronger as a result. A final war for the fate of China looms, between the Zhili on one side and the Fengtian on the other, but for now, Syndicalism in China has been thwarted, the KMT forced to retreat to holdouts in Yunnan and Fujian, and German influence in Eastern Asia made even greater.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_8_DESC;The Northern Expedition has grinded to a halt - the Kuomintang has been unable to break past the Yangtze, but their holdout in Liangguang and surrounding territories remains. With neither side willing to commit any more to the bloodshed, the hostilities have ceased. The southern regions of China have been reorganized to the Republic of China, or the Guangzhou Government, while the Zhili Clique, having suffered greatly in the war, has finally faded to the dustbin of history. The Fengtian Clique has reestablished the republic of the Beiyang Era, leaving the country divided between two republics, one Japanese influenced and the other veering towards left radicalism.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_9_DESC;The Northern Expedition has swept across China and the flag of the Kuomintang now flies above Nanjing and Beijing. A Republic of China has been established, following the tenets of Sun Yat-Sen's Three Principles of the People. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, wielding the fame of having led the National Revolutionary Army and united China, purges the party of Wang Jingwei's and Liao Zhongkai's radicals and establishes a period of 'People's Tutelage' in China. The path towards a united, modern state is not easy - Japan soon invades Manchuria and establishes a puppet state, while the rest of the country is a fragile mesh of warlords and autonomous governors controlled by a loose leash. Regardless, by 1936, the Republic of China is a state with a lot of potential and one with the chance to align with Germany, Japan, Russia, or carve out a bloc of its own.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_10_DESC;The Northern Expedition has liberated most of China from the chaos of the Warlord era - but Fengtian stubbornly holds its ground, unwilling to concede. As neither side is willing to commit any more to the bloodshed, hostilities have ceased, and while the rest of China becomes a republic led by the Kuomintang once more, Fengtian drifts straight to the Japanese sphere. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, wielding the fame of having led the National Revolutionary Army and united China, purges the party of Wang Jingwei's and Liao Zhongkai's radicals and establishes a period of 'People's Tutelage' in China. The path towards a united, modern state is not easy - Japan still holds Manchuria and draws designs to seize the rest of China, while the rest of the country is a fragile mesh of warlords and autonomous governors controlled by a loose leash. Regardless, by 1936, the Republic of China is a state with a lot of potential, and should it get its final revenge against Japan, it may field this potential to become a global superpower.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT26_11_DESC;The year is 1926, and the Northern Expedition is underway. The powerful northern warlords, who for over a decade waged internecine warfare among themselves, have finally turned their attention to the South. The Kuomintang�s National Revolutionary Army now surge northward toward the cities of Wuhan and Nanchang, aiming from there to take Nanjing, Shanghai, and eventually Beijing. For the Northerners, this has come at a bad time. They are in the midst of wrapping up what some have called China�s first modern war, and its aftermath has sapped what little legitimacy remains from the central government in Beijing. The Foreign Powers, Japan and Germany, who have intermittently supported various sides in China�s internal conflicts, look on nervously. The northern warlords had never been entirely amenable to their goals, which are mainly exploitative, but they were typically reliable factors with reliable interests. The Germans singularly look at the Northern Expedition and see a dire threat: Syndicalism, a red menace seemingly ever-present, and liable to now emerge once again in China. The Kuomintang are indeed partially funded and equipped by Paris, and there are known to be Bolshevist veterans in the midst of the National Revolutionary Army. When the first waves of the Northern Expedition tear through the Zhili Clique's defenses, the Kaiserreich is spurred into action. Something, its leaders say, must be done.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_91822_DESC;Lately there has been a rise in activity of the supporters of women's suffrage, that is those who want to grant women the right to vote and to run for office. In this troubled times for the German Empire, it is not easy to choose the best solution. Granting them what they ask would anger the more conservative elements of our government, especially the members of the Reichstag (currently elected by universal male suffrage). On the other hand, a stern refusal followed by reprisals may lead to riots and more protests, especially in the more liberal states (that already permitted female voting in regional assemblies). The third possibility is a compromise: granting women the right to vote and be elected in the local assemblies of all the constituent members of the Empire. But this last solution might only postpone the problem for the present time and we might have to deal with these suffragist again in the near future.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_91823_DESC;In the great war against the French syndicalist, German women have proven their loyalty and support for the Empire. Some of them proved fundamental for our propaganda efforts and many of them started working in factories to relieve the men that had to leave and fight the enemy at the front. Their contribution has been invaluable and they have proven their ability and independence. For these reason, the suffragist movement is stronger than ever and asking once again the government to grant women the right to vote and to run for office.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_91828_DESC;Inspired by the Cambridge Conference which took place during the Second Congress of the Internationale, in May 1937, another somewhat secret reunion took place today at the University of Cambridge. A group of theoretical physicists from Britain and France, led by Norman Feather, Fr�d�ric Joliot-Curie and Francis Perrin, are discussing the possibilities of radioactivity and nuclear fission and its uses - from electricity generation and medical applications to powerful strategic weapons.

EVT_91829_DESC;Our intelligence services have received important information regarding a meeting which has recently taken place on the University of Cambridge, in Britain. After a meeting of several theoretical physicists from France and the Union of Britain, the syndicalist powers have established the 'Damocles Project', a comitee for coordination of their research into nuclear power. According to the top nuclear physicists of the Reich, such as Hans von Halban and Albert Einstein, these efforts could lead up to the development of atomic weapons by our enemies - devices which could instantly kill tens of thousands and level entire cities. What should we do now ? Should we listen to Einstein's suggestions and establish our own nuclear weapons programme? Our general staff instead believes these reports to be mere rumors, however, and insist that any conflict with the Syndicalists can be won through our present, conventional doctrines and strategies.;;;;;;;;;;x

As we speak, German troops are already working to establish a beachhead in Shanghai, repelling the Guominjun from that important port city. At the same time, KMT forces should be directed to keep the Yunnan warlords pinned on their mountain redoubts, while also securing our rearguard and providing support for our advances. In a second phase, joint German-KMT forces should advance across the Chinese countryside and into Beijing, thus crippling the Guominjun armies. Finally, a thrust into Manchuria should defeat the Fengtien warlords.

EVT_91836_DESC;The creation of the state of Delhi had been the work of various local princes wishing to maintain regional stabilty when British India collapsed. However,  in the 1930's opposition to the current system increased and a new faction emerged, wanting a more centralised system of government. They are known as the Rashtravadi Party.

EVT_3968549_DESC;Quadragesimo Quinto Anno (Latin for 'In the 45th Year') is a new encyclical written by Pope Pius XI that discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order (45 years after Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum encyclical). The encyclical describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and syndicalism, calling for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. In the first part he reviews and applauds the encyclical of his predecessor, which helped the development of a new social conscience.\nAccording to Pius XI, three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family responsibilities, the economic condition of the enterprise and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and sound enterprises. For this, Pope Pius concludes that solidarity, not conflict, is a necessary condition. The pope therefore demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees through new forms of cooperation and communication among Catholic citizens.

Even some capital ships of our navy have switched allegiance to the Sacramento clique! In order to restore the rule of law, as the saying goes, 'from sea to shining sea', our military leaders have devised a plan for an immediate police action against the rebel PSA to forcibly return those states to the Union. Resistance is expected to be high, however, since many civilians and most of the military are now giving value to their newly-gained independence as a bullwark against the chaos that engulfed the rest of the country. Even on our own home states, the common folk is more interested in returning to their towns and rebuilding their lifes than on another round of this fratricidal civil war - if we go ahead with this invasion, we will surelly see a new set of major protests on our cities.

His plan dubbed Kaiserbund project proposes transformation of the current German colonial empire into the chain of dependent territories with limited international sovereignity. Such quasi states would allow economically troubled German Empire to gradually reduce colonial administration in favor of the local one, or even completely replace it, while German Empire would retain control over executive power, armed forces, foreign relations and economy of these newborn states. German Emperor would be formal head of state while head of the executive power would be nominated by the Emperor and approved in Reichstag. Such proposal, even if it promises to allow German economy to restore itself and bring potential for further growth, is viewed as absolute insanity by the right wing section of German society as well as parts of the Deutschkonservative Partei since in their opinion implementation of such drastic project would mean the beginning of gradual end of the German colonial Empire because local nationalist would definitively try to use such grand opportunity to intensify their effort aimed against territorial integrity of our colonies, not to mention loss of international prestige such step would surely brought, since implementation of this project would prove that German Empire is incapable of holding its vast colonial empire.....;;;;;;;;;;x

Our generals have prepared a preemptive strike at their positions in both Manchuria and their puppet republic of Transamur. Their plan involves, first, an advance by Russian and Mongol troops from Mongolia towards the Sea of Bohai, while also, at the same time, another force would cross the Amur river and attempt to secure Vladivostok before Japanese reinforcements arrive. Smaller forces must also secure our beachheads against possible Japanese landings, while our new airborne forces may be used to seize Sakhalin island, thus allowing the Russian Navy, albeit small, more freedom to operate, and also providing excellent bases for our naval bombers. The second part of the plan involves a joint strike towards Changchun, capital of the Manchurian Empire, in order encircle any enemy armies in northeastern China.

9000050desc;Prior to the First Weltkrieg women's role in society in western countries was generally confined to the domestic sphere and to certain types of jobs. In Great Britain for example, just before Weltkrieg, out of an adult population of about 24 million women, around 1.7 million worked in domestic service, 800,000 worked in the textile manufacturing industry, 600,000 worked in the clothing trades, 500,000 worked in commerce and 260,000 in local and national government, including teaching. The British textile and clothing trades, in particular, employed far more women than men and could be regarded as 'women's work'. While some women managed to raditional career paths, for the most part women were expected to be primarily involved in 'duties at home' and 'women's work'. Before 1914, only a few countries (New Zealand, Australia, and several Scandinavian nations) had given the right to vote to women, and apart from these countries women were little involved in the political process. With millions of men away fighting and with the inevitable horrendous casualties, there was a severe shortage of labour in a range of industries, from rural and farm work to city office jobs. During both Weltkriegs, women were called on, by necessity, to do work and to take on roles that were outside their traditional gender expectations. In Great Britain this was known as a process of 'Dilution' and was strongly contested by the trade unions, particularly in the engineering and ship building industries.;Avant la premi�re guerre modiale, le r�le de la femme dans les pays occidentaux �tait g�n�ralement confin� � la sph�re domestique (mais pas n�cessairement leur propre demeure) et � certains types d'emplois. Au Royaume-Uni par exemple, juste avant la premi�re guerre mondiale, d'une population f�minine adulte de 24 millions, environ 1,7 million travaillaient comme employ�es de maison, 800 000 dans l'industrie du textile, 600 000 dans le commerce des habits, 500 000 dans le commerce et 260 000 pour le gouvernement local ou national (incluant l'enseignement). Le commerce britannique du textile et de l'habillement, en particulier, employait bien plus de femmes que d'hommes et pouvait �tre consid�r� comme un 'travail de femmes'. M�me si certaines r�ussirent � suivre d'autres carri�res, les femmes �taient pour l'essentiel attendues � s'impliquer dans les 't�ches � la maison' et les 'travaux de femmes'. Avant 1914, peu de pays (Nouvelle-Z�lande, Australie et plusieurs pays scandinaves) avaient accord� le droit de vote aux femmes, et � l'exception dans ces pays, elles �taient peu impliqu�es dans la politique. Avec des millions d'hommes sur le front, et du fait des in�vitables tr�s lourdes pertes, il y eut une p�nurie de main d'oeuvre dans de nombreuses industries, du travail rural � la ferme aux emplois de bureau. Durant les deux guerres mondiales, les femmes furent requises, par n�cessit�, � prendre des r�les et des emplois en dehors des attentes traditionnelles li�es � leur sexe. Au Royaume-Uni, ceci fut connu sous le nom de 'Dilution' et fut vigoureusement contest� par les syndicats, dans les industries de l'ing�nierie et de la construction navale. Pour la dur�e des deux guerres mondiales, les femmes prirent des emplois traditionnellement vus comme ceux 'd'hommes qualifi�s'. Par contre, et en accord avec les n�gociations men�es avec les syndicats, les femmes ayant pris des emplois couverts par les accords de 'Dilution' perdirent leurs emplois � la fin de la premi�re guerre mondiale.;Prima della Prima Guerra Mondiale, il ruolo delle donne nella societ� moderna dei paesi occidentali era generalmente confinato nella sfera domestica e solo a certi tipi di lavoro. In Gran Bretagna ad esempio, proprio prima della 1a Guerra Mondiale, con una popolazione adulta femminile di circa 24 milioni di donne, approssimativamente 1,7 milioni lavoravano nei servizi domestici, 800 000 nell'industria manufatturiera tessile, 600 000 nel settore del vestiario, 500 000 nel commercio e 260 000 in governi locali e nazionali, tra cui molte insegnanti. Il settore tessile e d'abbigliamento britannico in particolare impiegava molte pi� donne che uomini e potrebbe essere considerato come un 'lavoro femminile'. Mentre alcune donne riuscivano ad intraprendere carriere tradizionali, in generale ci si aspettava che le donne di occupassero principalmente di 'attivit� in casa' e 'lavori femminili'. Prima del 1914, solo pochi paesi (Nuova Zelanda, Australia e alcuni paesi Scandinavi) avevano dato il diritto di voto alle donne e negli altri paesi le donne erano solo raramente coinvolte nei processi politici. Con milioni di uomini al fronte a combattere e l'inevitabile alto numero di vittime, ci fu una grave mancanza di personale in molte industrie, sia nelle fattorie rurali che negli uffici in citt�. Durante entrambe le Guerre Mondiali, le donne furono chiamate per necessit� a occupare posti di lavoro e ruoli che erano al di fuori delle aspettative per il loro genere. In Gran Bretagna questo processo fu fortemente contestato dai sindacati, in particulare nelle industrie ingegneristiche e di costruzioni navali.;Antes de la 1a Guerra Mundial, el rol de la mujer en la sociedad en los pa�ses occidentales estaba en general confinado al �mbito dom�stico y a ciertos tipos de trabajos. En Gran Breta�a, por ejemplo, apenas antes de la 1a Guerra Mundial, de una poblaci�n adulta de cerca de 24 millones de mujeres, alrededor de 1,7 millones trabajaban en el servicio dom�stico, 800.000 trabajaban en la industria de fabricaciones textiles, 600.000 trabajaban en el negocio de la vestimenta, 500.000 trabajaban en comercios, y 260.000 en gobiernos locales y nacional incluyendo la ense�anza. Las industrias textil y de vestimenta brit�nicas, en particular, empleaban muchas m�s mujeres que hombres y pod�an ser consideradas 'trabajo femenino'. Mientras algunas mujeres lograban tener formas de carrera tradicionales, se esperaba mayormente que las mujeres se involucraran en 'deberes hogare�os' y 'trabajo femenino'. Antes de 1914, s�lo unos pocos pa�ses (Nueva Zelandia, Australia y varios pa�ses escandinavos) hab�an concedido el derecho a voto a las mujeres, y fuera de estos pa�ses las mujeres se involucraban muy poco en la pol�tica. Con millones de hombres lejos peleando, y con las inevitables horribles bajas, hab�a una escasez de mano de obra en una variedad de industrias, desde el trabajo rural y de granja hasta los puestos de oficina en ciudades. Durante ambas guerras mundiales se apel� de las mujeres, por necesidad, para realizar tareas y asumir roles que estaban fuera de sus expectativas tradicionales de g�nero. En Gran Breta�a esto se conoci� como un proceso de 'Diluci�n' y fue fuertemente disputado por los sindicatos, en particular en las industrias de ingenier�a y construcci�n naval.;Vor Ausbruch des 1. Weltkriegs war die Rolle der Frau in den westlichen Gesellschaften meist auf h�usliche Dienstleistungen oder sehr wenige andere Arbeitsbereiche begrenzt. Im Vereinigten K�nigreich gab es zu dieser Zeit 24 Millionen arbeitsf�hige Frauen, von denen 1,7 Millionen im h�uslichen Sektor, 800.000 in der Textilindustrie, 600.000 in Bekleidungsgesch�ften, 500.000 im Handel und 260.000 im Staatsdienst ( Lehrerinnen eingeschlossen ) t�tig waren. Speziell die T�tigkeiten in Bekleidungsgesch�ften wurde von wesentlich mehr Frauen als M�nnern ausge�bt, was diese Berufe zu typischen 'Frauenberufen' machte. Vor 1914 gabe es nur wenige Staaten wie Neuseeland, Australien und mehrere skandinavische Nationen, in denen Frauen das Recht zu w�hlen hatten, womit sie sich auch nur wenig am politischen Prozess beteiligen konnten. Durch den Weltkrieg jedoch fehlten Millionen von m�nnlichen Arbeitern, so das Frauen auch in bisherigen M�nnerberufen in der Industrie und Landwirtschaft sowie in �ffentlichen Verwaltungen Fuss fassen konnten. W�hrend der beiden Weltkriege wurden Frauen mehr und mehr dazu aufgerufen Rollen zu �bernehmen, die ihnen vorher verschlossen blieben. In Grossbritannien wurde dieser Prozess als 'Verw�sserung' bezeichnet und zu Beginn von den Gewerkschaften bek�mpft, die vor allem verhindern wollten, da� Frauen in Ingenieurberufen oder im Schiffsbau besch�ftigt wurden. In beiden Weltkriegen arbeiteten also Frauen in sogenannten 'M�nnerberufen'. Nach dem Ende des ersten Weltkrieg mussten allerdings alle Frauen, die durch das 'Verw�sserungs' Abkommen einen 'M�nnerberuf' aus�bten, ihre Arbeitspl�tze wieder aufgeben. ;Przed wybuchem Pierwszej Wojny �wiatowej rola kobiet w krajach Zachodu by�a generalnie ograniczona do sfery domowej (chocia� niekoniecznie ich w�asnego domu) i �ci�le okre�lonych zawod�w. W Wielkiej Brytanii dla przyk�adu, w przeddzie� wybuchu I Wojny �wiatowej, po�r�d 24 milion�w doros�ych kobiet, oko�o 1,7 miliona pracowa�o jako pomoce domowe, 800 000 pracowa�o w fabrykach tekstyli�w, 600 000 w przemy�le odzie�owym, 500 000 w handlu, a 260 000 w sektorze publicznym, w du�ej mierze w nauczaniu. W przemy�le tekstylnym i odzie�owym pracowa�o daleko wi�cej kobiet ni� m�czyzn i dlatego te zawody uwa�ano za typowo kobiece. Jakkolwiek zdarza�y si� kobiety realizuj�ce swoje �cie�ki kariery w spo�ecze�stwie, dla wi�kszo�ci kobiet nie by�o �adnych alternatyw. Przed 1914 r. tylko kilka kraj�w (Nowa Zelandia, Australia, cz�� kraj�w skandynawskich) da�o swoim obywatelkom prawo g�osu, ale poza nimi zaanga�owanie kobiet w procesy polityczne by�o niewielkie. Podczas gdy miliony m�czyzn walczy�o i musia�o zmierzy� si� ze strasznymi stratami, wiele ga��zi przemys�u zmaga�o si� z powa�nym brakiem r�k do pracy, pocz�wszy od prac na wsi do prac biurowych w miastach. W czasie obu wojen �wiatowych, kobiety okaza�y si� z konieczno�ci potrzebne do wykonywania nietypowych dot�d dla nich prac, id�c na przek�r powszechnym przekonaniom o rolach p�ci. W Wielkiej Brytanii by�o to okre�lone procesem 'rozpuszczenia' i by�o bardzo ostro krytykowane przez zwi�zki zawodowe, w szczeg�lno�ci w budownictwie i stoczniach. Kobiety podejmowa�y bowiem zawody, dotychczas uwa�ane jako typowo 'm�skie prace'. Niezale�nie od prze�omowo�ci tego wydarzenia, wiele kobiet kt�re pracowa�o na typowo m�skich stanowiskach w czasie wojny, w wyniku porozumie� wynegocjowanych przez zwi�zki, straci�o swoje miejsca pracy po zako�czeniu I Wojny �wiatowej.;;�� ������ ������� ����� ���� ������� � �������� � �������� ������� � ����� ���� ��������� �� �������� ����� � ������������ ���� �����. � ��������������, ��������, ��������� �� ������ ������� �����, �� ��������� ��������� ����� 24 ��������� ������, ����� 1,7 ���. �������� � �������� �������� ��������, 800000 �������� � ����������� ��������������, 600000 �������� � ������� ��������������, 500000 �������� � �������� � 260000 � ������� � ������������ ��������������� �������, ������� ��������.���������� ����������� � ������� ��������������, � ���������, ����������� ������� ������ ������, ��� ������, � ����� ��������������� ��� '������� ������'. ���� ��������� ������� ������ ������� �������, �� ������� ����� ������� ������ ���� ���������� � ������ ������� '������������� �� ����' � '������� �������'. �� 1914 ����, ���� ��������� ����� (����� ��������, ��������� � ��������� ������������� ������) ���� ����� ������ ��� ������, � �� ����� ��� � ������ ������� ������� ���� ���� ��������� � ������������ �������. � �� ����� ��� �������� ������, ������� ������ � ����������� ���������� ��������, �������� ������ �������� ������� ���� � ���� �������� ��������������, ������� �� ��������� ��������� � ������ �� ����� �� ������� ������ � ������. �� ����� ����� ������� ����, ������� ���� ��������, �� �������������, ����� ��������� ������ � ����� �� ���� ����, �������  ���������� �� ��������� ����� ������������ �������� �� �� ����. � �������������� ��� ���� �������� ��� ������� '�����������' � ������ �������������������� �����������, � ���������, � �������������� � ������������.;;;X

EVT_662000_DESC;We are in a state of war with several countries with a significant Muslim population. Our dream is to spread Syndicalism to the Middle East. The local Syndicalist and Socialist parties don't have the sufficient strength to achieve this goal. One of the most famous Muslim Socialists and author of Islamic Communism, Mirsa Sultan-Galiev has declared his full willingness to help our cause. He has suggested in private conversations with several important officials that the nearly defunct Muslim Committee of the International could be turned into a powerful propaganda tool aimed at Muslims in the whole world.

This committee, with the help of Mirsa Sultan-Galiev, an infamous Tatar Bolshevik, is coordinating the efforts made by the Syndicalists in gaining the sympathy of Muslims everywhere. The Syndicalist powers have sent significant amounts of weapons and material to support the left-wing partisans in Turkey, Syria and Iraq. They have also opened a few training camps. To counteract this activity, we could declare Jihad against International. This appeal won't solve our problems, but it could be used in propaganda towards the Arabs populace of the Ottoman state.

EVT_662081_DESC;"5 years ago today the workers of Geneva began a major industrial action, demanding social and economic reforms, which threatened to spread to the rest of French-speaking western Switzerland (known as the Romandy). Fearful of potential revolutionary influence by the Commune of France, the central government in Bern reacted swiftly by sending in the Federal Army to break the strike. In the ensuing violence 13 were killed and over 100 injured in Geneva. This has left a bitter divide between the Romandy and Bern which over the subsequent years has failed to heal. Encouraged by recent developments in France the radical left has begun to agitate once more and is planning on standing Socialist candidates in the upcoming local elections. However the social democrats, traditionally very strong in the Romandy have devised a reform package in conjunction with the trade unions, the ""Peace of Work"" agreement, which involves a number of policies regarding wage increases, shift times and so on. One of the key points is to put an end to the massive lockouts in watch manufactures which have taken place recently. The social democratic candidates are relying on this program to be re-elected and hopefully defuse the stand-off between the radical left and the conservative dominated Federal government in Bern.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662082_DESC;"Backed by the conservative Federal government and the majority of the German-speaking cantons, the Swiss employer's organisations have refused to sign the so-called ""Peace of Work"" agreement proposed by the trade unions to put an end to the massive lockouts happing in the watch manufacturies. While the moderate social-democrats have been disgraced, French-speaking workers, whose resentment towards the current government and the Federal Army (largely dominated by German-speaking officers) has been growing since the violent repression of a workers' strike in Geneva in 1932, have returned a landslide victory to Socialist and pro-Syndicalist candidates in all cantonal elections, bringing in leftist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and Neufch�tel which are now calling for ambitious reforms.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662083_DESC;Thanks to the ill-advised measures taken by Swiss authorities to put an end to their unions' demands for better wages and legal protection of labour rights, our efforts to spread Syndicalism among Romandy workers in Switzerland have borne fruit and leftist local governments have been elected in French-speaking cantons.

However the pro-German and pro-Austrian conservatives will probably try to topple these worker's elected representatives by all means available including brute force...;;;;;;;;;;;x

The situation is getting too dangerous and a move to force the Socialist governments to step down and have new elections in the Romandy seems inevitable, even if it means temporary military occupation of the Romandy by the Federal army.

In spite of our efforts, some Socialist councilors have managed to escape to France and they are now calling for secession and armed resistance against Federal rule. Despite the repression, the Romandy is now being plagued by massive strikes and armed incidents as demoblised French speaking Army units form militias. Meanwhile, an unusual concentration of French infantry and tanks is currently exercising in the Jura mountains, and violation of Swiss airspace by French aircraft is becoming more and more frequent.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662086_DESC;The bourgeois Swiss government has shown its true face and has toppled the democratically elected Socialist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and other French-speaking cantons! Our agents have reported numerous atrocities against armed workers and civilians as the Swiss Federal Army has implemented martial law. Despite their best efforts, some French-speaking syndicalist sympathisers have evaded the Federal Army and found a safe haven in our country. They have just set up a secessionist Swiss-French government-in-exile and call for union with the Commune. Since none of the reactionary Powers seem to be willing to come to Switzerland's rescue, this is a one-time opportunity to send an ultimatum to Bern and add the Romandy to our territory.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662087_DESC;"The uneasy truce observed between the Federal government and the Socialist-controlled local councils in French-speaking cantons has come to an end. After several clashes between German-speaking soldiers in training and Geneva policemen, the Romand socialist leaders, pressed by the worker's militias, have proclaimed secession from Switzerland and the constitution of a so-called ""Romand Socialist Federation"". According to intelligence reports, the French and the secessionists have engaged in talks about an union between the Romand cantons and the Commune of France.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662088_DESC;Despite the repression conducted by Federal Army troops and loyal Romands, Socialist militias, reportedly using French-made heavy weapons and equipment, are on the offensive in almost all of the Romandy. Main lines of communication with the rest of Switzerland may fall under secessionist control, as well as most of the region's infrastructure. Geneva's State Council is besieged by pro-French militias and exiled Socialists are said to have returned from France to form a new and unified Socialist government.

At the unanimous request of the newly establish Communes of Geneva and Romandy, The Comit� de Salut Public has proclaimed their union with the Commune of France.

Last night French troops supported by tanks and bombers entered Swiss territory up to Fribourg, while elite French mountain troops have stormed our defensive positions in the Alps and in the Jura mountains. French state broadcasters have announced that the Romandy has been annexed to the Commune of France, all the while routed soldiers and refugees are arriving in Bern in the thousands. Our ambassador in Paris has been warned that any attempt to resist the Arm�e de la Commune would lead to massive bombings of Zurich, Basel and Bern and the total annihilation of Swiss military capacities.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662091_DESC;The Swiss Federal Army and its repugnant reactionary volunteer auxiliaries have defeated the heroic defenders of Socialist revolution in the Romandy. As thousands stream across the border to seek asylum in France, French-speaking militiamen are executed after mock trials, while right-wing activists and bourgeois hunt down Socialists, Anarchists an Syndicalists, loot their homes and take gruesome revenge on their families. Such atrocities, reported by our state broadcasters, are causing an uproar in France and every true Syndicalist is now ready to free the Romandy from the clutches of Switzerland's bloodthirsty rulers. As our aircraft are ready to take off and strike against Swiss territory and our troops are concentrating near the border, the Comit� de Salut Public has informed Bern that should the Romandy not be evacuated by the Swiss Federal Army and its control transferred to Communal authorities, war would be inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The premier is under great pressure to do away with the archaic system of indirect rule in favour of more efficient and democratic local administration, yet the survival of the Dominion was founded on the loyalty of the north-western princes in a time of great crisis - thus a complete abolition of their privileges might be unwise.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_101017_DESC;Now that the Unionist Party has scored a stunning electoral victory and ascensed to government at Delhi�s parliament, we are faced with an abhorrent number of pressing issues, dormant since the usurpation of Ganga Singh a decade ago. Most urgent is the status of administrative governance which have languished under the ancient relic of the diarchy - dual rule over the provinces shared between the officials of the central government and the domains of the many princely states, bound in subsidiary alliance and vassalage to the head of state. A feudal and reactionary party at its core, the Unionist government is hard pressed. On one hand the current setup is clearly not working, antagonizing the lower classes greatly, and on the other, any attempt at minimizing the influence of the maharajas might result in a severe backlash from within the party itself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101018_DESC;The Indian economy is falling apart. Archaic trade regulations, corrupt tax collectors and abhorrent lack of foreign investment is driving a sword through the neck of economic progress. Calling for a liberalisation of the thriftiness of our nation, the merchants, business magnates and industrialists of the Indus Valley are calling for reform to sweep the economic currents of the Dominion. Premier V. S. Srinivasa Sastri is himself not ill-disposed to these ideas which include a broad range of privatization, tax reforms, and institution of inflation-controlling measures. However, such a strong dose of liberalism might greatly upset the rural poor that still constitute the majority of the Dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101019_DESC;After a decade of military rule, the Indian economy has seen better days. Although rich in natural resources and foodstuffs, years of inefficient administration and lack of investment have seriously weakened the potentially powerful Indian economic sector. The Swaraj Party, standing for liberalism in combination with an empowered social sector - aimed at lifting the millions living in poverty into modernity - now stands at a crossroad. Some notables within the governing party have argued for a concentrated effort at strengthening social security and the Indian Civil Services whilst others believe an emancipated people can only true become free if the market is unshackled by the state. No matter what course is taken, it can certainly only be seen as progress.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101020_DESC;After a decade of military rule, the Indian economy has seen better days. The rich resources of the north-west are left underdeveloped in the face of a geriatric and inefficient administration combined with lack of foreign investments.

Known far and wide for his popular and borderline socialist economic views, Jinnah is expected to promulgate a wide reform of the financial sector, heavily aimed at restoring the economy to the reformed state�s control as to improve the welfare of the common Indian. However, such views are still quite controversial and even within the government opinions differ quite drastically.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101021_DESC;After a decade of military rule, the Indian economy has seen better days. The rich resources of the north-west are left underdeveloped in the face of a geriatric and inefficient administration combined with lack of foreign investments. The feudal landowners and agrarian landlords of the Unionist Party have risen to national governance and with them has emerged a new hope that the state will reorganize the tattered financial sector along a more efficient and powerful line, where the power of the landed elite reflect on the unwashed poor from the Punjab to the Vindhya Range. Still, there are those amongst the opposition as well as within the government�s more progressive cadres that argue against such a development - fearing it will lead to economic oppression on a scale even beyond what the British were capable of.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101022_DESC;In the wake of the our decision to restructure the landscape of Indian economy, calls have arisen from labour activists throughout the Dominion that our government solidify the rights of both the industrial and agrarian workers. Although the factories spanning from Khyber Pass down to Gujarat are relatively scarce, legislation in favour of the workers might serve to stem the tide of Syndicalist influence seeping into the trade unions. However, the backbone of the Liberal Party is founded on the support of business magnates and wealthy industrialists - a group fundamentally opposed to a strong and emancipated worker�s movement.

Yet the Swaraj Party is facing a thoroughly hard choice. On one hand, a great deal of electoral support for the party stems from the emancipated middle class who regard workers� rights positively, but another wing garners considerable financial aid and support from the industrialists and bankers of Delhi and Lahore.

EVT_101025_DESC;Since the Unionist Party swept into office in the last election a reform of the stagnate Indian economy has been passed and the status of the princely states been determined. However, demands have been presented by leaders of the nascent trade union movement of the north-west - demanding the government legislate in favour of greater workers� rights. Traditional and slightly reactionary in its origin, this is a very controversial demand for the incumbent Unionist cabinet. However, the movement for the betterment of workers� rights is an increasingly powerful organisation within the Dominion. As such a contradictory stance by the government and its landed supporters might risk driving the up and coming trade unionists into the arms of radical Syndicalism.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101026_DESC;Besides retaining informal sovereignty during the paramountcy of the British Raj, the Princely States also fielded their own private armies, ranging in size from mere regiments to several battalions of infantry, cavalry and artillery. Now, with our new government already having decided on the internal status the Princely remnants, the lingering question of what to do with their armies finally surfaces. Some argue that the Princes retain nominal control over the forces in question while at the same time expanding their ranks in order to keep them up to date with the regular state forces. Others believe it is time to bring the princely troops directly and unequivocally under the control of parliament as equal units to the standard army divisions. At the same time a minority of reactionary maharajas and feudal landowners advocate a maintaining of the status quo, although this approach is highly unpopular.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101040_DESC;As the dust began to settle after the Delhi Government's unification of the Indian sub-continent it quickly became apparent that a concerted effort was needed if India ever was to function economically. To this end a group of eminent industrialists has convened in recently liberated Bombay to formulate a proposal to restructure the economic landscape. Presided over by J.R.D. Tata and Ghanshyam Das Birla, the group has come up with several different plans to facilitate economic recovery in the face of the great industrialization and destruction that followed 20 years of civil war and division. However, the most contentious point of the plan revolves around the amount of state intervention in the private sector. No matter what course is taken, it's certain that the pointers of the implemented plan will definitely shape India for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101042_DESC;All India is no longer divided into three parts and the Delhi government stands triumphant from the Khyber Pass to the Bay of Bengal. The rival claimants to the mantle of successorship after the Raj have been eliminated and sound Indian democracy and respect for constitutional law completely enforced throughout the subcontinent. From Calcutta to Hyderabad the legitimacy of the Delhi government has been accepted by the many peoples, castes and religious groups of the Indian nation. Now it is time for India to march towards the future united and forever indivisible!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101050_DESC;In the late hours of the grand Hindu festival of Diwali  - the Festival of Lights - riots broke out in Dehradun. Hundreds upon hundreds of celebrating Indians utilized the gathering to launch spontaneous demonstrations against our governance of the Ganges-Yamuna Basin. Nepali shops were burned and the stationed garrisons came under siege. In the chaos of the flames, the governor of the city panicked and ordered the nervous police troops to open fire on a gathering around the Ghanta Gar, leaving around 50 civilians dead, riddled with bullets. As a result, the underground wing of the Indian National Congress has called strikes throughout the lowlands, reaching revolutionary heights in the East. From Delhi, Hyderabad and Calcutta feelings are running high as notables engaged in demagoguery call for Indian intervention in a lawful Indian land. It appears that his majesty, Tribhuvan Shah might better watch out.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101051_DESC;Riots against the Nepalese occupiers are breaking out throughout of the Ganges-Yamuna Basin, with insurgents taking up arms in Dehradun and Gorakhpur. Caused by the recent massacre committed by the Royal Nepalese Army on Indian protests celebrating the Hindu festival Diwali, these upheavals are proof that king Tribhuvan�s claim to the mantle of protector of his Indian subjects is shallow and hollow. However, the protestors are poorly armed and inexperienced, making their stand against the well trained and battle hardened Nepali gurkhas as frightening perspective. Conservatives and liberals stand united in this issue - no more Indians murdered by foreign troops! No longer can the Nepalese oppression and occupation of the Ganges-Yamuna be tolerated! Parliament is demanding that the government move to the aid of our endangered countrymen, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101053_DESC;In the West, Dominion forces are preparing to come to the aid of the rioting protesters in Dehradun, who have risen in response to a massacre orchestrated by the occupying police garrison. Nepalese army formations are deemed completely impotent in the face of such a modern foe and our intelligence detail among the underground local wing of the INC states that plans of open revolt are hatching in the East as well. A partition of the Nepalese occupied territories thus seems all but imminent. It seems that it will come easily with a dose of proletarian intimidation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101056_DESC;Our unification of the Indian subcontinent has come one step closer to reality. Today, the provisional government councils in the districts of Dehradun and Muzaffarpur have unanimously voted to apply for annexation into our union. Nationalist banners adorn the streets from the Kashmir Valley to the snowy tops of the Vindhya Range and the people amass at great rallies celebrating this great victory over dastardly foreign influence. However, given the invasion of troops loyal to the Calcutta government the people of the Yamuna-Ganges Basin have become divided - a setback certainly to be overcome in the time to come.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101057_DESC;King Tribhuvan�s attempt at stemming the tide of Indian indignation at the atrocities of his minions have been crowned with spectacular failure. Indian troops patrol the streets of Kathmandu whilst vanguard formations are making their way through the high vales and mountain crests adorning the road to Pokhara and other remote Nepalese cities. However, this victory poses our government with a new question - just how are we to handle this recently occupied territory? Nepal has a history of staunch independence, even refusing the British from their domains for a century, and how grand would it be to assume the role of hated occupier, for which we so recently scorned the Nepalese?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101058_DESC;Osman Ali Khan�s autocratic ambitions and hubris have finally driven the southern princes into open revolt! For the second time in a decade, the Hindu rulers of Mysore and Travancore waver in their oaths of loyalty towards their nominal overlord. Kannada and Malayalam troops already openly engage army units loyal to the Hyderabad government whilst the federal apparatus of state in the south has been thrown into absolute disarray. Consequently, with the Nizam�s administration barely clinging onto power in the Deccan Plateau, intervention by Dominion forces could result in the complete disintegration of one of the two other rival governments. However, such an attack could be risky, given the fragile balance of power between the three successor states to the Raj.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101059_DESC;Ever since the collapse of the Raj, a Tamil state has existed on the tip of the subcontinent. Once order descended into anarchy during the revolt of the southern princes the Madras presidency asserted itself as an independent state. After a short war the Tamil government was forced to cede key regions to the princely states of Mysore and Travancore and accept a humiliating treaty tying Madras economically and politically to Hyderabad in modern vassalage. But now, Osman Ali Khan and his princes have been subdued and the fire of Indian bolshevism extinguished. Alone and unprotected, the Madras government is vulnerable to any territorial demands we might present them with.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101066_DESC;A successor state to the late British Raj, Burma's recent history has been troubled. Destabilized by internal friction against the Konbaung dynasty and exploitation of the nascent oil industry, the Burmese have now been freed of the hassle of running their own country by our victorious troops. However, Burma was only a loosely integrated part of the Raj - and some officials within our own government strongly disagree with outrightly annexing the Burmese districts, instead advocating the creation of a nominal independent Burma - under the benevolent guidance of our own government of course.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101068_DESC;More than a decade after the Bolshevik rebellion, the central government has finally extinguished the fire of radical socialism on the sub-continent. Columns upon columns of marching soldiers and cohorts of trucks, tanks and armoured cars penetrate the interior of the Communard state, cementing our control over the vanquished usurper territory. However sweet this victory might seem, the cabinet is faced with a huge array of problems and issues facing our new administration. For the better of a decade's worth of time, the provinces of the Bengal, Orissa and Assam were subject to relatively strict socialist governance with the large estates of the elite expropriated, zamindars eliminated and the large tea plantations nationalized. We must replace this system of oppression and terror with a new kind of administration that will win the hearts and minds of the depraved peasants and workers of Eastern India.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101069_DESC;Some of the largest industries in all of India, the vast tea plantations of Assam have functioned as staggering  state owned entities until the downfall of Bolshevism in India. Now, the plantations are suffering under the strains of war and misadministration - resulting in poor production rates and massive dissatisfaction amongst the workers. It is our duty as a new legitimate government to address these issues and secure the support and loyalty of the workers in Assam - and maybe earn a little extra while doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101073_DESC;One of the Eastern provinces seized by the rebels in Calcutta in the chaotic days of the Raj, Orissa was at the time of the Bolshevik conquest characterized by the large numbers of native princely states. Although these petty rulers never rivalled Hyderabad or Kashmir in power, the Calcutta government was quick to expropriate and prosecute the zamindars and rajas of the province. Quite a few of these royal �migr�s sought refuge in Delhi, hoping one day to return to their estates and palaces. With the arrival of our troops in Orissa, that wish has now come true. However, a decade of socialist management has collectivized and divided a great deal of the �migr�s' estates with huge amounts of peasants and workers depending on the land to survive. The reactionaries within our state crave vengeance and a forceful return to the way of the 'Ancien Regime' whilst the moderates counsel restraint and compromise. Either way, the Government's choice certainly will determine our status as either liberators or conquerors.;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVT_101077_DESC;The Bengal was one of the most populous and prosperous of the Raj's many provinces. Heavily industrialized by Indian standards, the Bengal was also one of the first of Britain's Indian possessions to be majorly affected by socialist unrest. When the Raj collapsed, the Bengal proved a willing base of operations for Bose's campaign against Delhi and Hyderabad. In the ten years passing between the civil war and our conquest of the Calcutta Government, the massive industrial complexes of the Bengal have been expanded with help from the Union of Britain and a delicate bureaucracy of socialist administration put in place. Now these industrial behemoths lie in ruins after our troops swept through the province and different proposals have been presented as to how they can be brought back into shape. However, these industries proved a vital part in the social organization of the Bengal and a rapid restructure might harm our claim to legal rulership.;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVT_101102_DESC;Coinciding with his 25th birthday, the young maharaja of Travancore-Cohin, Shri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, has today proclaimed an edict facilitating the the end of the ban on low-caste hindus - also known as avarnas - entering the state�s many temples. The edict and its author have been hailed by progressives throughout the southernmost princely state, and a great deal of others, for the humane and magnanimous act of lifting the deprived and struggling towards greater self esteem and communal respect. However, a great deal of the more conservative Hindu landlords and nawabs throughout the Federation are disgruntled at this sudden leap of modernity, fearing their control over the less fortunate might slip away amidst such edicts of equality. For now, though, the legal changes remain confined to the princely state of Travancore-Cochin.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101103_DESC;If India was the jewel in the crown of British Imperialism, then the eloquent network of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway was the jewel within it. Originally constructed in 1853, it was the model upon which the Raj built its massive infrastructure of transportation, much envied by the rest of Asia and an inspiration for noted author Jules Verne. Renamed the Hyderabad-Deccan Railroad following the British withdrawal from southern India, this awe inspiring piece of engineering and logistics have sadly fallen into a state of decay. However, today a commission of experts backed by the southern gun-salute princes has addressed the Council with a plan for the expansion and renovation of what has been dubbed �... the artery of administration in the Deccan� - stretching the lines of rail all the way from Bombay to Cape Comorin. Such a prestigious project would certainly cement our standing as the legal successor to the British whilst boosting our fragile economy considerably.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101108_DESC;Ruling a domain equalling the British Union in territorial size, Osman Ali Khan became the leader of the Princely Federation when the southern rajas broke with the British crown to secure their privileges from Ganga Singh�s autocracy and Congress� socialism. However, Osman�s executive power has since been restricted, with the southern princes in Mysore and Travancore resenting any Hyderabadi hegemony. But with the threat of left-over British imperialism and socialist agitation on the rise in the north, the Nizam has come to the conclusion that for Princely India to survive, maybe even unite the remnants of the Raj, reform must be undertaken. Osman�s supporters hope that their champion assume imperial authority - continuing the style of the Mughals and queen Victoria. Others agree that reform is needed, but under a liberalized legislature, favouring the Hindu majority and the southern maharajas. The Nizam now steels himself for a proclamation that ought to change the nature of the Princely Federation radically.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101109_DESC;To the south, the primus inter pares of Princely India, Osman Ali Khan, has proclaimed himself the true successor to the mantle of Kaiser-i-Hind, the title previously borne by the Mughal and British emperors of the sub-continent. A direct proclamation that the Hyderabadi Nizam considers our own claim to legal rulership over the previous Raj as lower than the basest fiction! This bombastic claim has, besides obviously degrading our own state, severely upset the delicate balance of power in the South. Rumours are afloat that a great amount of southern princes are deeply offended at such a unilateral show of arrogance. Whilst some define the Nizam's illusions of grandeur as nothing but domestic squabbling, some foreign experts within our own corridors of powers speculate that imminent confrontation might soon erupt between the various nominally independent princely states within the Federation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101111_DESC;The astonishment of the world at Osman�s claim to imperial rulership has in no way surpassed the consternation of the southern princes whose distrust of Hyderabadi ambitions never lay at rest. Safely entrenched at his residence of Nazri Bagh Palace, Osman Ali Khan now faces a crisis within the executive branch of the Federation�s government as the delegated members from Mysore to Travancore angrily decries his supposed usurpation. The chief sycophants within the Nizam�s inner circle, now readily urges him to completely do away with this relic of administration and appoint a new national prime minister to handle the matters of state. However, though an abolishment of the council is a tempting idea, it might serve as a catalyst at driving the southern princes into total opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101113_DESC;The second most powerful of the gun-salute princely states, Mysore had always had a troubled relationship with the Nizam�s Hyderabad-centred administration. Barring religious differences, Osman Ali Khan and the king of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV had long had conflicting views on the level of centralisation of the Federation. Following the Nizam�s claim to Imperial regalia, these differences have come to the front, with the Wadiyar maharaja angrily denouncing Osman�s scheming and disregard for the federal constitution as a de facto coup de etat. Seeing no other way, the chief prince of the South has declared his domain independent and the union of necessity that once bound the erstwhile British princely states south of the Deccan Plateau together - dead and gone. Today is truly a dark day for the Princely Federation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101115_DESC;Governed by a progressive, headstrong and young ruler, the 19-gun-salute princely state of Travancore-Cochin never felt entirely at home under the leadership of the centralist Nizam of Hyderabad. Now, with the Maharaja of Mysore in open revolt against our government, the Malayam youngster has decided to throw the weight of the Combined princedom against our beleaguered forces! Troops loyal to the southernmost princely state have already defected, not caring to express any kind of loyalty towards the Kaiser-i-Hind!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101117_DESC;Ever since the federated gun-salute princes marched into the domains of the de-jure independent Madras Presidency in 1933 and wrested the southern tip of the continent alongside the Telegu and Kannada-speaking territories from the Tamils, revanchist fervor has been on the rise throughout the south-easternmost part of the subcontinent. Now, however, Osman Ali Khan�s Hyderabad government is facing extraordinary threats. With Mysore and Travancore-Cochin in open revolt against the hegemonic ambitions of the Deccan Plateau this might just be the time for the Madras Republic to regain its lost territories and teach the intrusive princes a lesson at the same time!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101121_DESC;Being a nation founded and ruled by the upper echelons of the Indian aristocracy, the will of the struggling masses is mostly a trivial ideal cherished only by the most progressive Rajas. However, popular satisfaction in regards to the people�s ability to influence the government has to be reached in some form, lest the troubled and depressed castes and races of the federation express their anger in violent protests and demonstrations. There are some who propose establishing a legislative chamber to support the heredative princes in their execution of rajadharma (the duty to rule), but the exact nature of such a chamber is still hotly contested.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101122_DESC;A legislative chamber where membership is hereditary, the Council of Princes has guided the gun-salute nation in its day to day business since the southern rajas rebelled against the Delhi government. However, pressure from the depressed masses since our limited liberalisation of the legislature has pressed the cabinet to address the issues of the Council. Some believe that the fig-leaf constitutionalism of the princely administration might be strengthened by creating a unified post for running the day to day affairs of the government. However, whether or not this position should be reserved for those of royal birth or made open for commoners as well is still a sore subject along the corridors of power. Never the less, the most feudal of the southern landlords are still strongly opposed to such a blatant attempt at pluralism within an inherent elitist state.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101124_DESC;At the start of the Weltkrieg, Hyderabad�s cotton mills employed more than half a million people thus contributing greatly to the income of the Nizam�s government. Surviving civil war and radicalization of the labour force, the cotton industry has nonetheless falling into gruesome disrepair. With the rest of the state�s political aspects being revitalized, it is widely believed that a reform of one of the Federation�s largest companies could produce a country-wide economic boom. However, the methods needed is widely disputed and many feel that a further increase in Osman Ali Khan�s economic power will disproportionately increase his influence within the government.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101125_DESC;In many ways the albatross around the neck of the gun-salute state, the mutilated remains of the Madras Presidency has never been loyal nor affectionate towards our government. Invaded at the end of the first Indian Civil War by princely troops, the Tamils were graciously granted autonomy - remaining outside of the Federation at the cost of territorial concessions. However, Dravidian radicalism has risen in force throughout the Republic and many officers within the national army daren�t leave such an openly hostile power unchecked whilst traitors and Bolsheviks remain strong in Delhi and Calcutta. Something must be done about the Tamil state!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101132_DESC;Large scale gold mining has been going on at the Kolar Concessions in Mysore state since the late 1850ies, but the evacuation of British experts and engineers following the Raj�s collapse meant that the local foremen haven�t been able to keep the facilities in order. Now, a recent surge of workers� unrest (primarily migrant workers from the North and South Arcot districts in the Madras Republic) over questionable living and production conditions and an ever rising request for the precious metal, the local government of Mysore has decided to remedy the situation. However, funds are scarce in the Wadiyar state and as such Mysore now turns to the Council of Princes for a pittance of monetary support.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101133_DESC;More than a year has passed since the state of Travancore-Cochin enforced a series of progressive laws to better the lot of the depressed Hindu castes, also known as untouchables, avarnas or dalits. Considered the lowest of the low within the Hindu caste system the people born into untouchability have always led a wretched existence, shunned by their betters and forced to take demeaning work.  However, Travancore-Cochin's Temple Entry Proclamation has greatly lessened the suffering of the state's avarnas and given them a new sense of communal pride. As such, Shri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma has now proposed to the federal government that the betterment of the downtrodden castes be made a national issue. Opposition amongst the reactionary and conservative Hindu princes remains staunch, however.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101134_DESC;When the British Raj fell the Bombay Presidency was dissolved and its Maratha districts partitioned between Hyderabad, Kolhapur and other Princely States. A new State of Bombay was then created to manage the vital port-city on the Arabian Sea, directly under the control of the executive. However, there have been calls for a new grand and unitary Maratha Princely State with the same rights as Hyderabad, Mysore and Travancore-Cochin in the Council of Princes. The so called State of Maharashtra would be of imposing size and industrial capacity, but ruled by a college of the various Maratha petty princes in unison. Within the larger and older princely states, there is much opposition to the creation of a new powerful federal state which could counter the interests of the established order. However, a strong Maharashtra would mean a more efficient administration and easier access for the federal army. Will the Marathi be elevated to national prominence?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101135_DESC;After a prolonged military struggle, the depraved leftists of Calcutta have finally been eradicated and their red flags torn down from the Victoria monument. However, even though we have fought our way through the humid jungles and forests of the Bengal and enforced Princely dominance throughout the eastern provinces - a decade of socialist governance has left a mark on our newly liberated territories. Our obligations to the zamindar emigres who hungrily eye their lost estates require a complete reversal of the collectivized farms and worker controlled factories - changes that ought to cause disturbances and unrest. We have won the war in the east - now we must win the peace, lest India remain divided.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101136_DESC;When the last civil war began, the revolutionary thugs of Calcutta drove scores of noble and princely families from their homes throughout the eastern provinces. A large part of these emigres consequently came to Hyderabad and formed one of the most militant and reactionary wings of the Council of Princes. Now that we have restored the ancien regim� and stomped out the horrors of socialism, these princes are calling for the disbandment of the collectivized farms and a return to the old rural order of the zamindari (landlordism) system. We certainly need to placate the victorious princes within our own government, but a break too sudden with the socialist model could be quite brutal and lead to much suffering amongst our new subjects. The Indian nation awaits the cabinet�s decision.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101140_DESC;The Bengal was the most heavily industrialized of all the Calcutta government�s provinces with factories and workshops being run by worker committees subject to the centralized doctrines of the socialist ruling cadres. Since our conquest of the province we have avoided the question of what to do with these industrial behemoths. Should the central government overtake the day to day business of operating the factories, or should we initiate a widespread bout of privatization? Others suggest that we let the local zamindars and princes take control of the complexes, thus taking a moderate stand. Whatever course the national government takes, it is certain to affect the reception our rule will receive from the workers and peasants of the Bengal.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101144_DESC;A province long renowned for its production of tea, Assam�s massive tea plantations actually prospered during their decade long tenure under socialist administration. Having employed thousand upon thousands of locals, the plantations supplied both the domestic markets with tea, but also made sure that the people of France and the Union of Britain received their fair share of the precious product. Now, however, the fields lay in disrepair. Like most everything else in the late socialist republic, we now have to make a tough decision regarding the future of this business. Should we maintain state control and secure the rights of the farmers and workers of the fields or should we wage complete war against the socialist economic system and uproot this collectivized remnant of the Calcutta government?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101149_DESC;When Osman Ali Khan rallied the southern princes behind the National Government not all of India�s native royalty rose to support him. A great deal of the northern princely states decided to throw their lot in with Ganga Singh and his Dominion government. Now that we finally have vanquished the traitor government we are left with the question of what to do with these princes. Either we let them retain their thrones or we forcibly depose them and install lesser royal houses more loyal to our own government. The latter course could, however, lead to a lasting resentment and prolong the time it will take to completely win the fealty of our new provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1011502_DESC;What the Delhi government lacked in princely strength it made up for in ridiculous pampering to its civilian citizens. Merchants, traders and even workers all had a certain degree of personal liberty and say in the day to day running of the state. With the establishment of solid native principles in their old government�s provinces, the masses are concerned that they might be cut off from any political influence or civil liberties in the times to come. If we were to address some of the issues concerned, such as the merchants� wishes for easy access to foreign trade, we might be able to ensure the transition from traitor to patriot rule go a lot smoother.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101163_DESC;Although Delhi is a far more centralized state than the Princely Federation, the colonial lap-dogs to the North have their own fair share of maharajas and zamindars. Most of these have rallied around the fig-leaf democratic legacy of the Raj, but some express strong conservative and anti-British views with Pratap Singh Gaekwad of Baroda State in Gujarat and Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir State being the two most prominent. If we could sway one or both of these princes to support our right to rule all of India, we might be able to weaken the Delhi government from within, making the advance of our troops that much swifter. The people awaits the National Government's decision.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101164_DESC;Although the current cabinet has reformed much of the apparatus of state and addressed the issue of the Diarchy, some maharajas remain staunchly opposed to the central government in Delhi. Both the young maharajas of Baroda in Gjurat and Jammu and Kashmir to the North look on our government with mistrust and hate, harbouring secret affections for the feudal regime in Hyderabad. We have received discomforting reports that either one or both of these princes are in clandestine communication with the Princely Federation about the possibility of secession from our state - opening an internal front against our army once the princes march North again. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1011506_DESC;The Andra Mahasabha was a people's organisation initially founded in the early 1920ies to further the use of the Telugu language over the prevalence of Urdu in Hyderabad State. However, over the course of its last four conferences, the movement moved farther to the left by developing concrete political aims at enforcing compulsory education, workers' and peasants' rights as well as a progressive democratization of the Princely Federation. Currently under the leadership of the great liberal intellectual Madapati Hanumantha Rao, the Andra Mahasabha is nonetheless sharply divided between its bourgeoisie leading cadre and the mass of leftist and Syndicalist workers and peasants that constitute its core source of support. Yet in spite of these differences, the movement has just held its fifth congress and there presented a quite radical and very anti-feudal proposal for constitutional reform. As a result there has been much upheaval within the more conservative circles of the Council of Princes with the most reactionary maharajas and zamindars demanding the banning of the movement. How should the executive react?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101250_DESC;In London, Oswald Mosley has, alongside a great number of revolutionary European dignitaries proclaimed a new socialist doctrine, uniting the most extreme and militant left-wing personalities of the continent behind the idea of Totalitarian Socialism. With its belief in an economy controlled by the state, the total involvement of the revolutionary vanguard in internal affairs and the importance of the state in preserving Socialism, Mosley�s new theses have greatly impressed Subhas Chandra Bose, the great martial hero of the Indian Revolution. However, Bose�s enthusiasm for this coordination of revolutionary ideology and its underlining of centralized and armed class struggle has greatly worried his opponents within the Calcutta Government. Never the less, Bose now sends his regards and support for this new doctrine to Comrade Mosley, stressing the need for cooperation between Calcutta and London in the proletarian struggle for the dissolution of the Capitalist system of murder and robbery.;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVT_101251_DESC;Whilst the support of Mussolini and Valois cemented Mosley�s new proletarian doctrine in Europe, news that the hero of the Indian Revolution, Subhas Chandra Bose, has endorsed the idea of Totalitarian Socialism really strengthened Mosley�s appeal within the British Union. Bose who almost crushed the imperialists in 1926 is almost seen as a idolized figure of the revolution in the Far East and as such, his opinion is highly regarded by many. Regardless, the notion of India and Britain, united as proletarian brothers instead of colonial master and slave has caught the people�s fancy.;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVT_101252_DESC;Dissatisfaction with the lack of popular involvement in government has sparked some of the greatest demonstrations seen in our country since independence was achieved in 1926. Stemming from the great and prestigious Rangoon University, radicalized leftist students have occupied several administrative buildings and held rallies denouncing the monarchy and its feudal backers as being corrupt and detrimental to the welfare of the nation. Still, the demonstrators haven�t managed to garner the support of the industrial workers and rural farmers, restricting the budding movement to the intelligentsia.;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVT_101253_DESC;In neighbouring Burma, riots are spreading amongst a political impotent youth. Protesting against the rampant corruption at Rangoon University, lack of reform and the natural autocracy of the decadent Konbaung dynasty. For now the demonstrations have been restricted to Rangoon, but the inactivity of the current regime might spell another outburst in the months to come, especially with workers at the oil fields in Yenangyaung, Chauk, and Minbu rumbling about lousy pay and poor living conditions. Should the two fractions unite we might find ourselves with a friendly government on the other side of the Bay of Bengal.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101254_DESC;Workers at the oil fields around Yenangyaung, Chauk, and Minbu have commenced a crippling strike in protest against rampant corruption and deplorable living conditions. Police units and paramilitary forces have in so far been completely unsuccessful in containing the protesters, who have occupied the oil fields, waving red flags and chanting anti-monarchy songs. Something must be done to placate their demands, lest national support for their cause explodes...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101255_DESC;Catastrophy! Just like the year before, students from Rangoon University has risen up against the monarchy in critical demonstrations and protests. However, this year the radicalized student leaders, lamenting still rampant corruption and autocracy, have joined cause with the equally disgruntled oil workers in Yenangyaung, Chauk, and Minbu, giving the movement a truly national scope. Short of backing down, and staining the monarchy�s honour, only a firm military reaction will solve this hopeless situation!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101256_DESC;After what seems an eternity, it has finally come down to a confrontation between the students protesting at Rangoon University and the Royal Burmese Army. News have reached the local commanding officer that a march of striking oil workers is making its way towards the capital, gathering support from the rural villages along the way. On top of all, orders are ticking in from the general staff for the army to disperse the protesters, as the day winds down it seems that Burma�s destiny is at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101258_DESC;In Burma, the corrupt Konbaung dynasty has been toppled by a coalition of protesting workers, students and an army refusing to carry out the order to massacre the latter�s peaceful demonstrations. Power now resides with a provisional Burmese government, still infant in its position and beleaguered to the East by a hostile Siam. Intimidated by the prospect of a possible civil war with the Bangkok monarchy intervening on the side of the disenfranchised feudal landowners, this new Burmese constellation has approached us with an offer of alliance, securing themselves against foreign involvement and gaining us a secure border to the East. Calcutta will have to answer swiftly and unequivalently lest this opportunity slip out of our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101259_DESC;In Burma, the corrupt Konbaung dynasty has been toppled by a coalition of protesting workers, students and an army refusing to carry out the order to massacre the latter�s peaceful demonstrations. Power now resides with a provisional Burmese government, still infant in its position and beleaguered to the East by a hostile Siam. Within said new government, a fraction led by U Ottoma has taken absolute control and has begun arguing for a reunification of the Burmese state with the naturally legal heir to the British Raj, namely our revolutionary Calcutta. A sizeable part of the Burmese state agrees with the proposition, hoping that united under one red banner we may obtain emancipation - not only for the workers and peasants of the Bengal, Orissa, Assam and Burma - but for all of India�s oppressed working men and women. The cabinet will have to make its decision swiftly, lest popular support for this union evaporate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101260_DESC;In the wake of Britain�s popular revolution in 1925, several attempts have been made to re-establish the flow of trade that flourished between the Home Isles and India during the days of the Raj - ranging from superficial attempts of diplomatic missions to all out engineering assistance by the railroad officials of the British Union. Now however, a proposal has been presented at the foreign office in Calcutta by a delegation from London aiming at systematizing and streamlining the socialist Anglo-Indian cooperation - granting the Indian government vital assistance in industrial and martial matters whilst securing the people and government of Britain a steady flow of exotic goods such as bananas, rubber and  - most importantly - unrestricted access to the tea plantations of Assam. The British and Indian peoples eagerly await the response of the Calcutta government.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101261_DESC;A most interesting proposal has just been wired to the officials at the Foreign Office by our consulate staff in Calcutta. In the midst of increasingly worrying development in the other Indian successor states to the imperialist Raj, our good friends and proletarian brothers in the Bengal are proposing a final economic deal to strengthen the backbone of their otherwise wobbly government with technical and industrial advisors from our British Union. In exchange, the workingman of Britain will receive a steady supply of bananas, tea and other exotic goods whilst his benevolent government gains access to vital resources such as rubber. R.H. Tawney, a seasoned politician with solid socialist credentials and good connections with Congress cadres in India from the early days of our Union, awaits the acceptance of London before boarding a ship to Calcutta to flesh out the deal.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101262_DESC;R.H. Tawney, the man who had ensured cordial relations between Calcutta and London in the chaotic days during the collapse of the British Empire has arrived once more in India! With him, he brings the greetings of our dear proletarian friends in the Union of Britain and promises of a new and empowered industrial cooperation between the working people of our nations. Tawney himself oversaw the first nascent dispatch of British railway engineers and with his own roots firmly planted in the soil of India he�s determined to ensure that this new round of cooperation develop successfully. All that remains, is for our government to name its request in exchange of London�s technical support.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101270_DESC;Osman Ali Khan�s autocratic ambitions and hubris have finally driven the southern princes into open revolt! For the second time in a decade, the Hindu rulers of Mysore and Travancore waver in their oaths of loyalty towards their nominal overlord. Kannada and Malayalam troops already openly engage army units loyal to the Hyderabad government whilst the federal apparatus of state in the south has been thrown into absolute disarray. Consequently, with the Nizam�s administration barely clinging onto power in the Deccan Plateau, intervention by Union forces could result in the complete disintegration of one of the two other rival governments. However, such an attack could be risky, given the fragile balance of power between the three successor states to the Raj.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101272_DESC;Always an experiment in degenerate feudalism, the Princely Federation on the southern tip of the sub-continent has begun to show signs of administrative fatigue. A recent call for reform of the apparatus of state has been filibustered in the Council of Princes by hardliners and religious enmity. As a result, the lack of reform has become extremely visible for all of India, especially within the Federation itself. The political disenfranchisement of the bourgeoisie and the appalling conditions for the workers and peasants are beginning to create a broad popular opposition against the ruling classes of cleptocratic princelings. Clandestine cells of the Indian National Congress and illegal trade unions are already flourishing in the south, although we have little say in the way they operate. If we were to unite the domestic resistance groups behind our government, we might be able to ferment an overthrow of the Nizam's dictatorship!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1012740_DESC;Having only just constituted itself for a fifth time in early 1938, the Andra Mahasabha has just held a sixth congress to address the growing unrest throughout Hyderabad State. With the policy of white terror being pursued vigorously by our military and constabulary against all signs of trade unionism and pro-socialist agitation, the left-wing sympathisers of the Andra Mahasabha has been increasingly militarized, their numbers growing daily. As the strength of the radical leftists continues to grow at the expense of the moderate liberals, the movement used its sixth congress to completely denounce the very nature of the gun-salute state! We cannot let this direct challenge to pan-Indian hegemony go unnoticed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101276_DESC;A popular movement with strong roots in both the intelligentsia and proletariat of Hyderabad, the Andra Mahasabha has just concluded its sixth congress in the midst of white terror and extrajudicial executions of trade union officials. Always divided between its more liberal leading cadre and its leftist core of support, the movement has now moved further to the left in the face of the stark police brutality of the zamindari state. In its closing statement, the Mahasabha finally abandoned its hope for constitutional reform in Hyderabad and openly called for the workers and peasants to throw off the shackles of the exploitation of the feudal princes and landlords. With the people of the Deccan Plateau readying themselves for the final struggle, we too must be prepared to intervene in the war against the capitalist system of robbery and oppression!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101287_DESC;Ever since the collapse of the Raj, a Tamil state has existed on the tip of the subcontinent. Once order descended into anarchy during the revolt of the southern princes the Madras presidency asserted itself as an independent state. After a short war the Tamil government was forced to cede key regions to the princely states of Mysore and Travancore and accept a humiliating treaty tying Madras economically and politically to Hyderabad in modern vassalage. But now, Osman Ali Khan and his princes have been subdued and the folly of imperialist democracy extinguished. Alone and unprotected, the Madras government is vulnerable to any territorial demands we might present it with.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101298_DESC;In Paris, a group of Indochinese revolutionaries under the leadership of Nguyen Sinh Con, also known as Ho Chi Minh, have announced their decision to form a united leftist government in exile whose declared goal is to topple German colonial rule. The Kaiserreich�s administration of the former French colony is shaky at best, with a revolutionary conscious indigenous populace and a steadily growing proletariat in the cities constantly agitating for national independence. It has been suggested that our government invite Ho Chi Minh and his comrades to Calcutta and place all available resources at their disposition. With an Indochinese government in exile based in Calcutta, we will be able to help and direct our comrades in their struggle against German capitalist tyranny. However, the decision is entirely in the hands of the cabinet.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1012501_DESC;With India united behind the Calcutta government and the provinces of the pretender governments brought under Socialist administration, the cabinet has begun to debate what course we should take internationally. A logical decision would be to seek an alignment with the International and thus formally take our rightful place amongst the great Syndicalist nations of the world. Others, however, argue that we ought to make our own bloc of alliances � a force of Socialism with an oriental face. Such a course would definitely allow us greater freedom when it comes to spreading the revolution, but might cost us the technological benefit of associating with the great armies of the International.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1012515_DESC;With the revolution secured at home, it is now time to turn our gaze to the rest of occupied Asia. Indochina is one of the nearest examples of continued European colonialism, having been conquered by the French at the turn of the last century, before being handed over to the Germans after the Entente�s defeat in the Weltkrieg. However, because of the chaotic circumstances of the Kaiserreich�s takeover, the Germans never quite managed to secure themselves in the role as colonial masters, which has resulted in the colony witnessing several uprisings of various nationalist groupings. Should we initiate support for the leftist and anti-colonialist movements within Indochina?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1012516_DESC;Ceylon was the site of one of the more important naval bases for the British Empire, serving as an important link between India and Singapore. Seized by the Germans once revolution swept through the British home isles, it has since continued to serve the Hochseeflotte in its tenuous domination of the Asian oceans. With the establishment of socialist power in India, we now have a solid base of operations to dislodge European colonialism from the Orient. However, given the island�s strategic value for the Germans, it might be difficult for us to expel them peacefully. The Central Committee will have to make a difficult decision if the Asian Revolution is to continue to prosper!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101201_DESC;Lala Lajpat Rai, president of the Indian National Congress and head of the Calcutta government, has begun to feel the strain of his advanced age creeping ever nearer. With the British lapdogs in Delhi reemerging as a serious contender to the mantle of the Raj's legal successor and the Burmese monarchy rattled by student protests and strikes, Rai has concluded that the government of free India will have to be refitted and reorganized if we are to keep up with the development of our neighbouring rivals - and as such he has decided to step down from his position. Rai�s resignation marks a potential end to the compromise government that emerged after the Indian Civil War, with both Gandhi�s moderates and Subhas Chandra Bose�s Maximists longing for definitive influence within Congress and the Calcutta government as a whole. Regardless, this Special Session called by Rai has been set for late january 1937.;;;;;;;;;;x ;
EVT_101202_DESC;Calcutta is steaming with excitement in the face of the 1937 Special Session of the Indian National Congress and the red flag flutters boldly from Writers� Building to the General Post Office. Inside the Calcutta High Court, the collected leadership of our republic�s government has convened for the ensuing election of Lala Lajpat Rai�s successor. It is expected that the appointment of a new head of state will mean a fresh gush of change within the nation�s cabinet, prompting the various fractions to scuttle for the floor in order to garner the most influence in all the various commissaries and committees that manage our country. Three wings have emerged within Congress. Bose�s Maximists emulate Mosley�s British Totalitarian Socialism and regard military force as a necessary revolutionary act for India�s unification whilst Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi leads a pacifist, egalitarian and agrarian wing - striving for a negotiated end to the subcontinent�s fragmentation. Standing between the two extremes is a coalition of trade unionists and ardent proponents of industrialism led by A. K. Fazlul Huq and his young protege Jawaharlal Nehru. As the opening speeches begin to ring across the floor, the 1937 Special Session seems bound to change the path of free India in the next years.;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVT_101203_DESC;Although the greatest landowners and princes of Bengal and Orissa were deposed and their fiefs expropriated after the Calcutta government asserted itself in the years following 1926, the Bhartiya Commune never truly made the transformation into a socialist society. Lingering still in the villages and the smaller cities, the Zamindar system of the olden days continue to shape the days and lives of those who should have been lifted into prosperity by the glorious revolution almost a decade ago. Subhas Chandra Bose has taken the floor and delivered a crushing speech against this feudal instrument of oppression, demanding an immediate end to the privately owned great farms and mansions and their subjugation to complete state control. A sensitive issue, the debate on the rights of the remaining landlords have begun to spin out of control and a decision will have to be made.;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVT_101204_DESC;At the end of the first week of the Special Session, young Jawaharlal Nehru has taken the floor, arguing for a further increase in our nation�s industrial output and greater economic control by the state. Opposed to this, stand the Gandhian wing of Congress, determined as they are that the heart and soul of Mother India is not her great cities, but the Harlequinesque patchwork of rural villages from Cape Comorin to the Mouth of the Indus. Accordingly, they believe that the influx of state support should flow into the countryside, developing the rice paddies and benefitting the average Indian. The Maximists, on the other hand, find both Nehru and Gandhi�s proposals far too limited in their scope and hopelessly unambitious. Instead, Bose�s supporters argue that the state is more than capable of undertaking expansion in both sectors, requiring, of course, that the government absolutely control these endeavours.;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVT_101205_DESC;Despite the fact that the Indian National Congress managed to rally the nationalist and revolutionary movement behind itself during the Indian Civil War, opposition from the rival governments in Delhi and Hyderabad meant that Calcutta only managed to secure Bengal, Assam and northern Orissa before the war winded down. Since then, the Bhartiya Commune has been at peace with her neighbours, but with changes in both Burma, Delhi and in the gun-salute prince�s federation, unfolding at a unnerving pace, it is obvious that the special session will have to address the lingering question of unification. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, always a staunch opponent of violence, supports a negotiated end to to the division of the subcontinent. Given how hard the revolutionaries had to fight during last days of the Raj, this stance is rather controversial and both Huq and Bose find the notion all but treacherous. Nehru argues that the government should wage realpolitik and take opportunities as they come whilst Bose has bombastically announced that neither Nizam nor Dominion shall obtain any concession.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101206_DESC;After much deliberation and exhausting debates, the Special Session of Congress has finally endorsed the platform proposed by Subhas Chandra Bose and his Maximists. The venerable war hero now ascends to absolute leadership within the Calcutta government bringing with him a following of idealist and radicalized socialists. Gandhi is appalled at this blatant endorsement of violence and his left Calcutta for his ashram, giving Bose a benevolent audience for his acceptance speech. With the internal division now solved, our rivals around the continent will certainly have cause for worry!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101207_DESC;Sweeping into office, A. K. Fazlul Huq and young Nehru have soundly defeated all opposition to their pragmatic line of realpolitik. With Congress behind them, the new government will be able to enforce realistic, just and revolutionary policies throughout India. Already, news of the election has spread into the interior of our small republic, prompting spontaneous celebrations in its many villages. From now on, our goal and objectives are clear-cut! Total unification at any method!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101208_DESC;Prevailing against the extremist ranting of Bose and the dangerous warmongering of Fazlul Huq, the Great Soul, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, has finally established a solidly moderate government in Calcutta. Hoping that his quest for peace throughout India now will commence, Gandhi has definitely seized control of all major offices within cabinet. Hopefully, unification and swaraj will now arrive momentarily!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101209_DESC;Despite long debates and late scheming in the corridors of power, no absolute victor has emerged from the Special Session of the Indian National Congress. Greatly frustrating to the ageing Lala Lajpat Rai, who hoped to deliver the fate of Free India into secure hands, the venerable leader has completely resigned any influence in the bogged down political metamorphosis. In his stead as mediator, both Bose and Gandhi frantically attempt to appeal to young Jawaharlal Nehru for support, at least creating some semblance of coalition.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101212_DESC;The workers at the Yenangyaung Oil Fields were the primus motor of the recent Burmese revolution. Their strike against the capitalist system of robbery and oppression was what galvanized the latent dissatisfaction with the Konbaung dynasty into a fullscale uprising within both the military and the general populace. As the Burmese republic ascended to the Bhartiya Commune it now falls upon our government to determine how the means of production in Yenangyaung should be handled. The Anarcho-Syndicalist wing of the Indian National Congress argue that the local trade unions, being the true representatives of the local workers, ought to take full control of the oil fields. On the other hand, Bose's Maximists present a strong argument for complete state control and involvement in the day to day running of the plants. The government will have to make a clear decision to ensure the cooperation of our new Burmese comrades.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101213_DESC;At a local labour meeting in Calcutta close by Writer�s Building, Shripad Amrit Dange and several prominent veteran revolutionaries such as Atulkrishna Ghosh and M.N. Roy have proclaimed their intention to organize a truly syndicalist and militant revolutionary organisation within the dominant INC. Seeing both Bose�s Maximist and Gandhi�s agrarian wings as compromised and Fazlul Huq�s centrists as corrupt, the group hopes to contest for commissary and delegate positions on the next round of elections to the government. Invoking the name old name �Anushilan Samiti� (meaning �Self-Culture Association�) the group strongly advocates the use of force to overthrow the Hyderabad and Delhi governments as well as an economic system based on anarcho-syndicalist policies of cooperative farming and union controlled industries.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101214_DESC;After almost two decades of division, our victorious armies have finally united the Indian sub-continent. From Hyderabad to Kashmir and from Ahmedabad to Calcutta the red standard of Indian socialism flutters freely. However, even though all armed resistance has collapsed we now have to rebuild the shattered bourgeois and feudal social structure anew in a proper Socialist image. Our attitude towards replacing the various capitalist and feudal economic systems of our enemies will surely determine how easily the new citizens of our great republic shall accept the rule of a new all-Indian Socialist Raj!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101215_DESC;With the war between the Indian states successfully concluded, we now have to determine how to integrate the provinces previously administered by the reactionaries into our state. Opposition groups within Congress are calling for a new special session to be held to determine the methods applied in this regard. The government is riding on a wave of popular support in the wake of the war�s end and looks likely to maintain its mandate, but the profiles in opposition are never the less demanding to be heard. Either way, it�s the government�s decision.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101216_DESC;The provinces of the vanquished reactionary states were organized in a predictably feudal manner. Princes administered some whilst others fell under bourgeoisie control. Before venturing into debating what concrete political changes should be made to the societal structure of our new domains, Congress must first decide how to administer the new districts. Bose�s Maximists argue for large blocs of coherent ethno-linguistic provinces together forming the backbone of the centralized state, whilst Gandhi�s Agrarians take the opposite stance and recommend smaller sub-state entities controlled by local village communes. Nehru�s industrialists favour middle-sized linguistic states modelled on traditional provincial divisions whilst Dange�s Anarcho-Syndicalists suggest a union of council-driven provinces created by popular referendums. As the delegates take the floor the first debate on the future of India is about to unfold!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101217_DESC;Prevalent throughout non-Socialist India, but especially in the Princely Federation, the zamindari system was a feudal institution of exploitation where landlords held economic and social power over the workers and farmers working on their factories and estates. With our liberation of the suffering proletariat Congress now has to decide what to do with the means of production. The Maximists argue for swift centralization, the Agrarians as always favour local village authority, the Industrialists demand a balance of central and local ownership whilst Dange�s wing suggest orthodox Syndicalist theories of trade-union control as the solution to the administration of the liberated economic institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101218_DESC;The Indian sub-continent is as diverse economically as it is ethnically and religiously. The merchants in Bombay and Karachi thrive on foreign trade through the Strait of Hormuz and the Suez, whilst the peasants of the Gangetic Plain toil mainly for themselves and their local communities. It is thus extremely complex to tailor an economic policy that is able to cover all the various business and enterprise strata. However, that is just what Subhas Chandra Bose is proposing. Envisaging a total state involvement in all layers of business, the Maximists claim that only such drastic measures can ensure the total eradication of the capitalist society and the substantiation of a true egalitarian and socialist India. Naturally, the other wings of Congress beg to differ�;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101219_DESC;As the army finished off its last opponents, the military consequently took on the role as a force of occupation. This is in some cases discouraging for our newly liberated brothers, as the presence of army patrols make us look not as the liberators of the proletariat, but rather as foreign invaders. Some voices in Congress call for a more lenient strategy towards the new provinces, whilst others argue that a reduction of army units will inevitably pave the way for reactionary terrorists and guerrillas.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101220_DESC;A veritable mass of patterns of different ethnicities, religious and caste sub groupings, Indian politics have always swayed between the extremes of cultural accommodation and subjection. The Calcutta government has employed a wide variety of policies within our own territories to maintain the rights of the so-called untouchables, people ostracized from society on religious grounds found in mainstream Hinduism. All parties agree that minority rights are essential, however, the means of enforcing these in the far more traditional and conservative provinces recently liberated from reactionary rule seem to be far more difficult to agree upon. As the Congress draws to a close, it is evident that this last issue will be invaluable for any of the fractions who wish to secure a majority.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101313_DESC;Today a historical offer of a bilateral and negotiated end to the division of the late Raj has been wired to our foreign ministry. The origin? Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi�s official residence in Calcutta. With the demise of Osman Ali Khan�s union of princes only the leftist governments in Calcutta and Delhi remain, and Gandhi sees no need for the recent debacle surrounding Mysore State�s sovereignty to result in bloodshed between Indians who, for better or worse, all remain sons of the same Mother India. Jinnah, for his part, sees no reason for hostilities to erupt before Gandhi�s proposal has been heard. It is widely believed that a peaceful end to the division can be achieved, although the price of the needed compromises appear high. Maybe even too high...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101314_DESC;Muhammed Ali Jinnah, prime minister of the Dominion of India - our rival to the mantle of sole successor to Britain�s Raj - has through his own foreign ministry contacted our diplomatic liaison in a third country regarding the possibility of a negotiated end to the division of the sub-continent. Spurred on by the nascent flow of popular democracy erupting from the emancipated peoples of the Deccan and Mysore�s decision to align itself with our government, Jinnah sees ample opportunity for our two cabinets reaching an understanding in regards to both the future of Mysore and India as a whole. However, even though Messrs. Gandhi and Jinnah both pursue dreams of a united India, reformed in leftist democracy - many fear that their respective extremist fractions might react strongly, if one side should garner too many concessions in the coming elections.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Turkish state has seen tremulous times over the last few years with revolts, rebellions and sedition coming from all sides. The ill man of Europe seems to be in the middle of his death-throttle and Mother Russia stands to profit from this. However, the scope of our ambitions could very well affect the chance of success.

EVT_661968_DESC;The once might German Empire has been expelled from mainland Europe, the invincible Reichswehr reduced to scattered bands of guerrilla fighters and its allies of the Mitteleuropa system crushed one by one. The Reich had, however, one last hope for victory: its vast colonial empire could provide the imperial government and the army with the resources to, one day, defeat the invaders of the Fatherland and return the glory for the German folk. This dream was quickly turned into a nightmare, as their colonies across Asia and the Pacific themselves started to fall to foreign powers and local resistance movements, be they syndicalist or nationalist in nature. After a series of munities in the armed forces, the Imperial government has realized the futility fo their struggle and decided to surrender unconditionally to us.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The aim of this ideology, called 'National Renewal' is to reconstruct the Russian state into an entity capable of defending Russian interests and citizens all over the world.

EVT_610015_DESC;Totalism, also known as Totalitarian Socialism, is an authoritarian interpretation of communist and syndicalist ideology currently promoted by some important European socialists, such as Benito Mussolini from Italy and Oswald Mosley from the Union of Britain. Totalism puts a great emphasis on the establishment of a strong and centralized state in order to properly defend the socialist revolution. Critics, however, say that Totalism is a repressive tool that will, ultimately, lead to a degeneration of the socialist ideals and the establishment of a bureaucratic class who will take any steps necessary in order to stay in power... Despite these critics, our own president follows a similar interpretation of socialism, so maybe it's time to officially endorse Totalism?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_610020_DESC;The anti-clerical measures adopted by the Federal Government have made some fruits, as we gained a small ammount of funds due to the expropriation of Church property. Other provisions of the new anti-clerical laws include the prohibition of wearing religious attire in public and the loss of the clergy's right to vote. All foreign priests and missionaries are also being expelled from the country, while the religious schools will be over the next few months taken over by the State. This, however, comes at a heavy price: most of our heavily Catholic population disapproves these measures. On the central-western states, there's even talk of peasants taking up arms in order to protect their parishes and priests!;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_610148_DESC;Since the signing of the Mexican Constitution of 1917, the Roman Catholic clergy has been deprived of a number of civil rights, such as the right to vote and own property.

Ever since the Sinarquistas have established their new nationalist regime, some fringe groups have started advocating for the restoration of monarchy in Mexico under a devout Catholic monarch. These groups have slowly gaining more and more support both among the political classes, to the point that on today's session of the Senate, sinarquista senator Manuel Torres Bueno has openly proposed a Third Mexican Empire to be instituted. Of course, most of our population is happy to live under a republic and would strongly oppose this scheme.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Fearful of potential revolutionary influence by the Commune of France, the central government in Bern reacted swiftly by sending in the Federal Army to break the strike. In the ensuing violence 13 were killed and over 100 injured in Geneva. This has left a bitter divide between the Romandy and Bern which over the subsequent years has failed to heal. Encouraged by recent developments in France the radical left has begun to agitate once more and is planning on standing Socialist candidates in the upcoming local elections. However the social democrats, traditionally very strong in the Romandy have devised a reform package in conjunction with the trade unions, the ""Peace of Work"" agreement, which involves a number of policies regarding wage increases, shift times and so on. One of the key points is to put an end to the massive lockouts in watch manufactures which have taken place recently. The social democratic candidates are relying on this program to be re-elected and hopefully defuse the stand-off between the radical left and the conservative dominated Federal government in Bern.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662802_DESC;"Backed by the conservative Federal government and the majority of German-speaking cantons, Swiss employer's organisations have refused to sign the so-called ""Peace of Work"" agreement proposed by trade unions to put an end to the massive lockouts in watch manufactures. While the moderate social-democrats have been disgraced, French-speaking workers, whose resentment towards the current government and the Federal Army (largely dominated by German-speaking officers) has been growing since the violent repression of workers' strike in Geneva in 1932, have returned a landslide victory to Socialist and pro-Syndicalist candidates in all cantonal elections, bringing in leftist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and Neufch�tel which are now calling for ambitious reforms.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662803_DESC;Thanks to the ill-advised measures taken by Swiss authorities to put an end to their unions' demands for better wages and legal protection of labour rights, our efforts to spread Syndicalism popular among Romand workers in Switzerland have borne fruit and leftist local governments have been elected in French-speaking cantons. This is a great opportunity for the Commune to forge stronger ties with them. However the pro-German and pro-Austrian conservatives will probably try to topple these worker's elected representatives by all means available including brute force...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662804_DESC;While the newly elected Socialist governments in Romandy have stepped into office, Federal intelligence services are reporting that French agents have crossed the border to advise the Romand leftists and partial mobilisation of French border units near Geneva is also said to be under way. The situation is getting too dangerous and a move to force the Socialist governments to step down and have new elections in the Romandy seems inevitable, even if it means temporary military occupation of the Romandy by the Federal army. But the risk of triggering a French armed response is high though and we cannot be sure of Mitteleuropa's support...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662805_DESC;"The Federal Council, backed up by local French-speaking conservatives, has ordered ""sure"" (i.e. German-speaking) Federal Army units to enter Romand cantons to introduce martial law. Socialist leaders, as well as many workers and Syndicalist sympathisers, have been arrested and provisional local governments are being set up under Federal supervision. In spite of our efforts, some Socialist councilors have managed to escape to France and they are now calling for secession and armed resistance against the Federal rule. Despite the repression, the Romandy is now being plagued by massive strikes and armed incidents as demoblised French speaking Army units form militias. Meanwhile, an unusual concentration of French infantry and tanks is currently exercising in the Jura mountains, and violation of Swiss airspace by French aircraft is becoming more and more frequent.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662806_DESC;The bourgeois Swiss government has shown its true face and has toppled the democratically elected Socialist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and other French-speaking cantons! Our agents have reported numerous atrocities against armed workers and civilians as the Swiss Federal Army has implemented martial law. Despite their best efforts, some French-speaking syndicalist sympathisers have evaded the Federal Army and found a safe haven in our country. They have just set up a secessionist Swiss-French government-in-exile and call for union with the Commune. Since none of the reactionary Powers seems to be willing to come to Switzerland's rescue, this is a one-time opportunity to send an ultimatum to Bern and add the Romandy to our territory.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662807_DESC;"The uneasy truce observed between the Federal government and the Socialist-controlled local councils in French-speaking cantons has come to an end. After several clashes between German-speaking soldiers in training and Geneva policemen, the Romand socialist leaders pressed by the worker's militias, have proclaimed secession from Switzerland and the constitution of a so-called ""Romand Socialist Federation"". According to intelligence reports, the French and the secessionists have engaged in talks about an union between the Romand cantons and the Commune of France.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662808_DESC;Despite the repression conducted by Federal Army troops and loyal Romands, Socialist militias which are reportedly using French-made heavy weapons and equipment, are on the offensive in almost all of the Romandy. Main lines of communication with the rest of Switzerland may fall under secessionist control, as well as most of the region's infrastructure. Geneva's State Council is besieged by pro-French militias and exiled Socialists are said to have returned from France to form a new and unified Socialist government. It also seems that the Federal Army has no control over the Swiss-French border anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662809_DESC;The brave workers and peasants of the French-speaking Swiss cantons have won their fight against the reactionary forces of the Bern government! At the unanimous request of the newly establish Communes of Geneva and Romandy, The Comit� de Salut Public has proclaimed their union with the Commune of France. While the local militias are being integrated in the Communal Army, French motorised units, supported by air forces, are heading towards the new border to prevent any retaliatory offensive from a revanchist Swiss government.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662890_DESC;The treacherous Socialist rebels in the Romandy which had been on the verge of being wiped out by our brave soldiers, have called the Commune of France for protection! Last night French troops supported by tanks and bombers entered Swiss territory up to Fribourg, while elite French mountain troops have stormed our defensive positions in the Alps and in the Jura mountains. French state broadcasters have announced that the Romandy has been annexed to the Commune of France, all the while routed soldiers and refugees are arriving in Bern in the thousands. Our ambassador in Paris has been warned that any attempt to resist the Arm�e de la Commune would lead to massive bombings on Zurich, Basel and Bern and the total annihilation of Swiss military capacities.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662891_DESC;The Swiss Federal Army and its repugnant reactionary volunteer auxiliaries have defeated the heroic defenders of Socialist revolution in the Romandy. As thousands stream across the border to seek asylum in France, French-speaking militiamen are executed after mock trials, while right-wing activists and bourgeois hunt down Socialists, Anarchists an Syndicalists, loot their homes and take gruesome revenge on their families. Such atrocities, reported by our state broadcasters, are causing an uproar in France and every true Syndicalist is now ready to free the Romandy from the clutches of Swiss' bloodthirsty rulers. As our aircraft are ready to take off and strike against Swiss territory and our troops are concentrating near the border, the Comit� de Salut Public has informed Bern that should the Romandy be not evacuated by the Swiss Federal Army and its control transferred to Communal authorities, war would be inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662892_DESC;"The rampant rebellion of the French-speaking minority around Nanzig (formerly Nancy) has recently worsened. Those people, whose perposterous calls for cultural autonomy have never ceased in spite of the French defeat and a comprehensive policy of Germanisation of the area, have become more arrogant after the Swiss have cowardly given in to the French demands and the leftist Romandy has been annexed by the Commune. As the reunion of Lothringen to the Reich was to be remembered in Nanzig with a massive military parade and speeches from high-ranking officials, and even if tens of pro-French local leaders and identified Syndicalists had been put under preemptive arrest, the celebrations have been interrupted by massive riots in Nanzig as well as in the whole area up to Metz. Official buildings have been set on fire, armed squads have opened fire against the police on Stanislas square and the Staathalter has barely escaped an assassination attempt in the town hall, while German-speaking homes, shops and factories have been looted by the populace and many German-speaking civilian assaulted or even murdered ; in the countryside and the industrial towns, local representatives of the Reich are targeted by terrorist cells. Mineworkers in French-speaking Lothringen are now on strike and despite a swift and ruthless repression, the situation is now getting out of control. Supported by the nationalist feelings of the common people, DVNP members of the Reichstag are calling for a massive deportation of French-speaking people from Lothringen to Silesia and Eastern Prussia ; Lothringen and parts of Elsass are now under martial law, troops are coming from all parts of the Reich to squash the rebellion, and the Kaiser has demanded immediate action to restore order in Lothringen.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662893_DESC;"As Germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Victory and the reunion of all of Lothringen to the Reich, the festivities that took place in the city of Nanzig, formerly Nancy, have been tarnished by violent demonstrations from the French-speaking minority, who never fully integrated in our Empire and is still complaining about economic discrimination and social repression. As the military parade and speeches from the Staathalter were met by insults and catcalls from the populace, the demonstration has worsened and turned into a riot ; official buildings have been attacked by armed protesters, killing two policemen, and a number of German-speaking civilians have been assaulted by the mob. Even if the police has regained control of the streets and many demonstrators, including French-speaking militant leaders, have been put under arrest, the situation is still extremely tense. Mineworkers from French-speaking Lothringen have went on strike and discontent is fueled by French propaganda. In Berlin, where the public opinion calls for drastic measures, the cabinet is about to put Lothringen under military administration until law and order are restored.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662894_DESC;After the British Revolution collapsed the American economy, upstate New York and the states east of it reoriented towards Canada to preserve their economies. Too conservative for Syndicalism but too moderate for America First, New England has become isolated from the rest of the United States and is now effectively in Ottawa's sphere of influence. Joseph Kennedy, representing the political and business elite of the region, quietly informed us today that should the worst come to pass and the government in Washington prove unable to defend them, the state governments would allow Canadian troops to garrison in them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662895_DESC;"Right-wing circles have been calling for a crusade against Commune of France ever since communards managed to oust legal French government from mainland France. Now their wishes have finally came true, as state of war exist between our glorious Vaterland and the nest of syndicalist vipers. After Kaiser Wilhelm II explained in a special radio adress reasons for Germany's involvement in another war with France and called for eradication of final obstacle to achieving ""Place in the Sun"" thousands of young Germans rushed to enlist in the military, following the example of Kaiser's grandsons, and civilians began gathering on streets manifesting their support for war. After catastrophic crisis German nation is united once again. Long live Germany! Long live the Kaiser!";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662896_DESC;A month before elections yet another scandal was revealed by the media. Die Gartenlaube, newspaper owned by Alfred Hugenberg, reported that two daughters of Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, general and friend of influential Reichskriegsminister von Schleicher, were involved in shady dealings with syndicalist intelligence. Shortly after Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, didn't find out that family of war minister's associate was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While general von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publically apologised for his daughters doings, the real question for von Schleicher was - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - by whom ?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662897_DESC;Economic crisis has shaken the belief held by milions of Germans in their great country, and as an effect both social-democratic and radical movements started gaining on popularity. Reichskanzelor von Papen hoped to turn the tide by announcing weekly radio adresses in which he would announce what steps has the government taken to combat the crisis. Despite critics saying that since the beginning of these auditions chancellor prefers to spend time in broadcasting company's headquaters rather than in Reichstag, the broadcast proved to be a great success.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662898_DESC;The despicable Red rulers in Paris feel bold enough to defy our supremacy and are now overly supporting the rebellion in Lorraine ! Despite the appropriate measures enforced in the Western regions, many Germans consider that the ever-growing threat from the Commune now has to be firmly contained, and our allies in Flanders-Wallonia have publicly expressed concern their own security, questioning the effectivity of German protection. After long and extensive talks with the Kaiser and the top military, the Chancellor has approved partial mobilisation of the reserves and is considering massive military exercise in Alsace-Lorraine, complete with air and armor detachments and military observers from Mitteuropa member states, to prevent further French provocations.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662899_DESC;"At 6 AM this morning, the so-called ""military exercise"" organised by the German Army has proved to be nothing more that a treacherous act of agression against the Commune ! At least two artillery batteries have opened fire across the border and have shelled Leval, a small and undefended village near Belfort. Twelve houses and buildings have been destroyed and 26 people, mostly women and children, have been slaughtered in this cowardly attack. The survivors are being evacuated as border troops, reinforced with longe-range artillery, are now facing the murderous German units. An emergency session is being held at the Bourse G�n�rale du Travail, while the Chief of Staff has just come back with his aides from Besan�on to Paris to consider the most appropriate response to such a despicable attack.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662900_DESC;The bloodthristy French have thrown their mask away and are revealing their intention to attack Elsass-Lothringen ! At 6.30 AM this morning, a platoon of French tanks has crossed the border east of Muhlhausen and opened fire against the peaceful, unguarded village of Bretten, before retreating. The local church and several houses have been shelled of destroyed by fire, killing at least 19 people. Prince Wilhelm has been called back to Berlin and is to report the situation to the Kaiser as soon as possible, while the Cabinet is now evaluating the crisis and is discussing the best option to answer this odious crime.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662901_DESC;Once again, the German nationalist reactionaries are attempting to squash worker's struggle for emancipation ! Inspired by the victorious Romand revolution and the reunion of French-speaking Swtizerland to the Commune, our long-oppressed comrades from Lorraine have at least decided to shake free of the Kaiser's yoke, taking arms against the occupants and its German-speaking capitalist settlers. Alas, bloodthirsty hordes of soldiers and militiamen have been unleashed from all parts of the German Empire and are now ravaging Lorraine. Many Syndicalists have been executed after hast mock trials and French-speaking civilians are fleeing west up to the French border, where facilities have been built to welcome these refugees. Mass demonstrations in French cities are spontaleously organised to call for revenge, and although some pacifists from the Anarchist press have expressed reservations, the Comit� de Salut Public, under pressure from the General Staff, has informed our friends from the Internationale that the  Commune, now confident in its strengh, is ready to help the revolutionnaries in Lorraine by all means available.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662902_DESC;In spite of a ruthless policy of Germanisation and repression of Syndicalist activity, our lost fellow comrades from Lorraine have revolted again the Kaiser's rule. During a provocative celebration of the twentieth anniversary of German occupation, thousands of French-speaking Lorrains have taken control of Nancy and other areas in Lorraine, raising the red flag upon their town halls and closing down every mine and factory. However, brute force is now suppressing the Lorrains struggle for freedom and social justice and despite undecover help from our intelligence services, the German police,supported by army detachements, has put hundreds under arrest, while extrajudicial executions have been reported in Longwy and mining cities are under martial law. Put under pressure by outraged French people, the Comit� de Salut Public is discussing the General staff's proposal to perform a show of force at the German border in an attempt to come to the French-speaking militants's rescue.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662903_DESC;"Our agents in Berlin and Strasbourg have informed us that an unprecented concentration of German troops is planned in Alsace and Lorraine under the guise of ""military exercise"". Such an aggessive move from the German autocracy, at a time when Lorrains are desperately fighting for their freedom, is nothing more that a desperate attempt to test our resolution; however such a plan is bound to backfire : to prevent further German provocations, partial mobilisation of the Communal army divisions in eastern regions has been ordered and a show of force may be performed in Franche-Comt�, near the Alsatian border, where newly-created armored regiments are to exercise in combined operations with infantry divisions and air support.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662904_DESC;"It now seems that the Lorraine crisis can not be resolved unless the French are humbled once again, and the time has come for Germany again to show its force. In this regard, at the request of the Kaiser,his grandson and future Kronprinz Prince Wilhelm von Preussen will attend the military exercise organised in Alsace-Lorraine under the name ""T�chtiger Bogensch�tze"" (the name was chosen because new long-range artillery prototypes from Krupp factories are to be tested in real conditions during the exercise), which will be the largest concentration of troops since the Weltkrieg. No less than 8 divisions will be deployed near the French border, where fortifications have been fully manned. 3 air regiments and armored units will also take part in the operations, which will be followed by many European military attach�s. Ready to march on Paris, these troops will surely make the Commune back down in terror !";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662905_DESC;"German sabre-rattling and a ever worsening situation in Lorraine have convinced the Comit� de Salut Public to give in to the General Staff's request for a wide-scale military exercise at the border that will prove the uncompromising resolution of the Commune to both friends and foes ! The high-ranking officers have decided in favour of a major combined arms exercise in northern Franche-Comt�, which will be named ""Op�ration Kl�ber"". Four infantry divisions and two motorised infantry divisions, with their divisional artillery units, will face the Germans near Belfort, while bomber and fighter wings will train in coordination with an armored division equipped with the newest medium and heavy tanks. Impressed by our modern and unstoppable military force, the Kaiser and his minions will have no choice but to retreat behind the Voges mountains !";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662906_DESC;"An unfortunate incident has just occured during the military exercise in progress in Elsass-Lothingen. Two of our new long-range artillery batteries, manned by young recruits, have mistakingly shelled a small French village by the name of�Leval due to poor fire range evaluation. According the the Red French broadcast, several locals would have been killed by this accidental shelling. Military police is currently interrogating the officer and NCO's in charge, but the French, shamelessly taking advantage of the situation, have issued an inflamarory statement demanding official apologies from the Kaiser and Cabinet and threatening Germany of ""unpredictable consequences"" if we refuse to comply.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662907_DESC;"A regrettable episode has just taken place at the German border during the combined military exercise currently organised around Belfort. A tank platoon, misguided by faulty map directions, has accidently crossed the border and confused a�fake hamlet built for fire exercises with a small Alsatian village named Bretten, shelling this town in the process. German reports suggest that a few civilians have died during the incident. Military intelligence officers have been immediately sent on the spot to investigate and the commanding lieutenant has been put under preventorty arrest. However, the warmongering Germans are outrageously taking advantage of this incident, and the Comit� de Salut Public has just recieved an insulting ultimatum from Berlin, demanding an official apology and the ending of our military exercise, under threat of ""extremely severe consequences"".";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662908_DESC;"Germany has been impressed by our uncompromising stance and has admitted its responsibility in the infamous Leval massacre ! After our ambassador in the Hague has informally met a plenipotentary sent by the Chancellor, Berlin has issued a formal apology statement from the Kaiser and has withdrawn some troops from Lothringen, which our recon forces have confirmed. Our Foreign minister, as well as our allies from the Internationale, have asked the Comit� de Salut Public to accept this apology. However, such a decision would certainly disappoint a now revengful and bellicist French public opinion ; more importantely, during an extremely tense secret meeting with the CSP, the General Staff has warned that, should German apology be accepted without further compensations, the Army would not yield to the civil power's decisions without internal dissent and attemps to mutiny.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662909_DESC;As expected from the imperialists, Germany has not only refused to apologise for its crimes, but has called for general mobilisation ! Active and Landwehr divisions are gathering between Wallonia and Switzerland, while our fighters have been engaged in an isolated dogfight with German planes above Sedan and sporadic gunfire exchanges are reported all along the Lorraine border. War seems now imminent : however, moderate members of the Bourse G�n�rale du Travail are worrying about our level of operational preparedness and have declared that they would vote in favour of a temporary retreat, in order to wait for new tank and bomber models that should be delivered in a few months now. On the other hand, top ranking military officers consider that war is unavoidable and stress the fact that victory can be achieved now with a swift offensive against the heart of the Reich, before Germany can fully use its industrial power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662910_DESC;"After our Ambassador in Mexico has been informed by the French diplomatic mission that our ultimatum would be answered very soon, the Communards have formally apologised for their shameful act of war in Bretten and have withdrawn�their troops from Belfort. The Cabinet now wants to give priority to the Lothringen crisis and would be reportedly ready to accept this apology as long as the French military exercise is immediately cancelled, but is wary of the public opinion's reaction ; the Kronprinz has incidently expressed his wish to ""humble the Red murderers"" during an improvised press conference in Karlsruhe, and the Generalstab has advised against any sign of leniency that could be misunderstood by the French for a sign of weakness.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662911_DESC;"It is now obvious that the Commune has planned to go at war with Germany, the so-called ""Leval masacre"" being nothing more than a convenient excuse ! As general mobilisation has been ordered by the ""Comit� de Salut Public"", our signal�corps units in the West report that massive concentrations of troops, including armored and motorised formations, have been deployed from Sedan to Belfort, while French fortifications near the Flemish border seem to have been significantly reinforced. At least one French plane has been shot down above German territory, and a few skirmishes have opposed our soldiers to French units near the Lothringen border. A strong majority within the Cabinet and the Kaiser's entourage, encouraged by massive nationalist meetings in all major cities, is eager to declare war and finish the French off for good. However, some military circles are less than enthusiast, warning that the modern, innovative, well-trained French army is nothing like its battered 1919 counterpart and should not be underestimated.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662912_DESC;"Unsatisfied by our sincere apology after the Leval incident, the Commune, whose best divisions are now concentrating at our border, now pretends that the bombing of Leval, being a deliberate agression in time of peace, must be compensated by Germany, and demands financial reparations to cover material as well as moral damage suffered by the victims and French public infrasctuctures. The German people will not accept to give in to such endless and unbased claims ; however, the military situation is deteriorating fast as French commando units have successfully crossed the border in at least four occasions, even if for a short time, and have made contact with French-speaking militants in Lothringen ; so it might be wiser to agree to pay these reparations and ease the tension with the Commune.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662913_DESC;As gunfire exchanges and dogfights are increasingly frequent, diplomatic overtures have been made by the French to discuss a negotiated ending to the Lothringen crisis. Paris claims to be ready to demobilise its troops, save for the border�guard units, and will end all support to French-speaking Lothringen palamilitary formations in exchange of German demobilisation and retreat from the French border. Accepting this offer will give us the opportunity to restore order in Lothringen, and the crisis will end with a diplomatic victory for the Reich. On the other end, the French just might want to buy time before launching a large-scale, thoughfully prepared offensive against our country...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662914_DESC;"Despite our goodwill gesture, Germany now claims that the so-called ""Bretten mass murder"" has caused heavy material damage to the whole area and that victimes have to recieve monetary compensations. The German cabinet has publicly�demanded that the Commune pays reparations, both in gold and in various raw materials and industrial resources, so that Bretten and its surroundings can be rebuilt at the French people's expenses. This new claim has been met with fierce opposition from the public opinion and radical factions within both the Bourse G�n�rale du Travail and the Army suggest that all negotiations with Germany should be terminated. But the military situation at the German border is undecided as several infrantry units near Nancy have suffered damage from German artillery gunfire, and our forces might be not in position to successfully engage the Kaiser's army for now...

This is an obvious victory for the Commune since the aggressive imperialists have been forced to kneel down before the workers and peasants' unstoppable might. But we should also be wary of a ruse de guerre from the treacherous Generalstab and strike before Germany does...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662916_DESC;"Germany has finally given in to our legitimate claims and will pay 10 million Reichsmarks as compensation for the shelling of Leval.

Our plan to drive the German Empire down to diplomatic defeat has failed, and now we are left with two options : facing defeat, while tens of thousands workers are rallying in Paris ""to march on Berlin, the vicious capital of the reaction"" and some top-ranking officers are rumored to set up a coup against the civilian Comit� de Salut Public ... or going at war with the German Empire.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662918_DESC;"Reason, for once, seems to have prevailed in Paris. The Commune has informed the Chancellor that our reparations claims would be satisfied and that all French miliarty activity would stop by the end of the week. Bretten victims will be�granted monetary compensations from a 10 million Communal French francs fund payed by the French, and the Reich will recieve raw materials -including aluminium- and agricultural products for reconstruction. The Commune has suffered a major diplomatic defeat and will certainly not try to confront the Reich for a few years ; the Kaiser has, therefore, asked the Cabinet to put an end to military exercises at the French border and withdrawn all troops not assigned to police operations in Lothringen.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_662919_DESC;"The French answer to our compensation demands has been an increasing level of military actions at our border and terrorist attacks in Nanzig and Strassburg and threats of total war !

Late last night, the celebration of the Hindu festival of Diwali turned violent as hundreds upon hundreds of Indians utilized the gathering to launch spontaneous protests against Nepal�s occupation of rightful Indian soil. A local police commander lost his nerve and ordered his troops to fire upon one of these demonstrations, leaving 50 civilians dead.

EVT_101094_DESC;Burma broke away from the Raj in the chaos of 1925, re-establishing the Konbaung dynasty on the throne in Rangoon. Strikes by oil workers and students resulted in a violent revolution culminating in the proclamation of a leftist republic in 1937, heavily influenced by the Calcutta Government. This influence has also meant that a large number of Syndicalists have sought refuge in Burma, wherefrom they continue to wage a deadly guerrilla war on our military and constabulary in Assam as well as in the Bengal. If we wish to completely crush militant Socialism in South-East Asia, we must eliminate the Burmese support for these fanatics - in effect meaning that we must enforce some sort of regime change in Rangoon. However, how to do this is still debated heavily within the cabinet.;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, the apparatus of state that handled the Northwest for all these years haven�t accommodated the nature of the newly incorporated provinces of the princely and socialist pretender states. Although the Indian Civil Service and the legislators in Delhi are aware of the issues of popular resentment against living in archaic districts not corresponding to their local communities, a movement has begun to arise throughout the country - its leaders demanding structural reform of the country and the reorganization of the existing provinces along linguistic lines.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1010200_DESC;With India reunited and peace restored to the sub-continent, the government has turned its attention to rebuilding our great nation�s foreign relations and has thus invited a large number of foreign dignitaries to attend an Asian Relations Conference in Delhi. Ostensibly called to discuss the various social and cultural issues facing the new order in South-East Asia, the conference quickly turned to discussing ways to assert economic recovery and coherence between ourselves and our immediate neighbours. As a result, the foreign office has proposed that we create a customs union to foster free trade and thus generate more commerce between the states on the subcontinent. However, some of our neighbours are fearing that our economic might could transform such a union into the first tentative steps to a �Customs Raj� - in other words, the onset of Indian economic hegemony.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1010113_DESC;With the government secured in parliament by a comfortable majority, one of most pressing matters requiring our attention is the issue of the Linguistic Movement. Having spent the last few years gathering political momentum, the idea of a united India subdivided into constituent states along linguistic lines has now garnered a considerable following in Saurashtra, Assam and Bombay State. However, if the government were to commence such a major reform it would, in theory, completely eviscerate what little power the remaining Indian princes wield. Furthermore, there are those in, e.g. the Punjab, who�d rather see the implementation of a reorganization that also took the religious nature of the provinces into account. Still, the issue must be solved - lest the government lose its initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_101241_DESC;At a preliminary meeting of the Industrialist Clique, Jawaharlal Nehru has openly challenged A. K. Fazlul Huq for leadership of the grouping. The split comes as no surprise to the political observers of Calcutta as Nehru has grown more and more disillusioned by the Tiger�s singular preferable treatment of the Bengal. Hungry for the power needed to transform India along his own radicalized Fabian lines, Nehru launched a scathing attack on the elder Huq�s political dealings with Nehru-loyalists Lal Bahadur Shastri and Gulzarilal Nanda immediately following up with their own denouncements of the old weary course. Visibly shaken by the coup and clearly lacking support from the majority of the grouping, Huq grudgingly abdicated leadership of the clique in favour of Nehru who then proceeded to purge anyone not voting in his favour.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1012001_DESC;In the wake of Indian reunification under the aegis of the Calcutta government, a major source of discontent across the subcontinent has proven to be the lack of central direction of the judicial system. With some provinces and districts being in the hands of local workers� and peasants� committees and others still ruling based on the old colonial codes, the Congress is in agreement that a more effective and streamlined legal apparatus is sorely needed. However, how such a system precisely should function - and who should control it - is hotly debated by all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1012002_DESC;Five years have passed since the States Reorganization Act was adopted by Congress, yet friction still exists between the provinces and the central government as to who should wield the most influence in the villages and cities of India. The Maximists wish the states to be completely subjugated to the rulings of the executive, only retaining insignificant administrative power. The Agrarian Wing, on the contrary, argue that the complex nature of the Indian nation calls for a loose confederation of states with the executive only permitted supreme control of defense matters and All-Indian industries. Dange�s Anarcho-Syndicalist share Gandhi�s mistrust of a strong central government, but suggest creating a coordinating States Committee elected by local trade unions to ensure some coherence amongst India�s provinces. Nehru proposes a quasi-federal structure with each province retaining a token legislative as well as chief ministers and governors, who in turn answer to the central government.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1012004_DESC;The Revolution might have triumphed in India and heralded in a new era of Socialist brotherhood under the aegis of the Red Raj, but the world is still plagued by the twin evils of the possessing classes - feudalism and capitalism. Although we already have a significant diplomatic presence abroad, the issue of our commitment to the international welfare of the Syndicalist system has come up as an important point in today�s debates. As usual, the most glaring difference is between the Agrarians and Bose�s Maximists, with the former advocating a peaceful promotion of Socialism within India whilst the latter argue bellicosely for the revolution to be promoted abroad at bayonet point. Dange and Nehru occupy a middle position.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1012005_DESC;Although the Indian Red Army was successful in its charge to secure the reunification of the subcontinent under the control of the Calcutta Government, it has become a too rigid organization with conflicting loyalties.

Both Nehru and Bose believe in a strong army, but the former places far more emphasis on reforming and upgrading the existing equipment, whilst Bose wishes to expand all three service branches while also enforcing a strict hierarchical command structure with full military discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_907501_DESC;The question of the future of Mecklenburg-Strelitz arose at the Kaiser's discretion. Uncertainty has persisted since 1918, when the death of Adolf Friedrich in 1918, and since then the duchy has been ruled directly from Schwerin. Now, when it comes to electing a new ruler, the favorite is Georg, the nephew of escaped Karl Michael. Christian Ludwig, recognized by Schwerin, is a pretendant, but the government rightly sees this as strengthening the role of the Mecklenburgs. There's also the option of uniting Mecklenburg, although in times of crisis it looks expensive and unpopular. How will this be solved?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9000065_DESC;From the start it was obvious that there would be some problems integrating the Irish-Americans into our Republic. The wealthier note the lack of democracy as they knew it in the US while the less well off feel that their situation is being exploited by Irish business. Locals also have grievances as they feel the newcomers are stealing jobs from them as well as seeing their cultural traditions as not in keeping with native Irish culture, and regard them as 'Fake Fenians'. To top it off Unionists view the immigrants as an attempt by the Republic to colonise Ulster, where many have settled.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9000085_DESC;Before the creation of Foras na Gaelige, there had been several earlier attempts to encourage the revival of the Irish language. This began in the mid 19th Century and closely mirrored the political struggle for Ireland's independence from Britain. However, once the political struggle was won, the promotion of Irish culture and Gaelic revival fell from prominance despite the efforts of various orginisations. It has been suggested that these be collected under the umbrella of Foras na Gaelige (The Irish Institue) to better direct them towards our current goals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9000086_DESC;At the moment the largest concentration of natural Irish speakers is in the west of Ireland, areas known as Gaeltacht. However the Irish spoken is often local dialects, making promoting the language difficult due to the various differences. An Foras na Gaelige has advised the creation of a standard dialect of the Irish language. This would be known as An Caighde�n Oifigi�il (The Official Standard) and would make education easier for both Gaeltacht and English speakers alike.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9000087_DESC;With the goal of spreading Caighde�n Oifigi�il throught Ireland, education is key. This is to be done by making Irish language classes a required part of state curriculum, with a goal of eventually teaching fully in Irish. Some want the policy moved forward faster though by making fluency in Irish a requirement for admission into university. Church leaders who have been looking for a means to overturn our secularisation are opposed to either and wish a return to 'true Irish tradition of respect for the Church'.;;;;;;;;;;;x

Several Irish-Americans in Foras na Gaelige have offered to share their experience of the Boy Scouts of America, to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues, using the methods which were in common use by Boy Scouts in the USA.

EVT_830081_DESC;A Syndicalist government now rules in Dublin. While this has been greeted with trepidation by the press and the general public, members of our General Staff and Military Intelligence see opportunity. In their haste to subdue Collins' regime the Unionists may have created an opening that we may exploit. Support for the King remains strong in the north, Collins was unable to subdue the loyalist elements fully and the reds will likely fare no better. By secretly supplying arms and equipment to loyal factions in Ulster we could count on them, once the war with the Syndicalist dogs comes, to rise up for our cause. In doing so they might secure for us a foothold in Ireland, putting us within reach our ultimate goal, the restoration of our United Kingdom! Intelligence has also contacted several groups opposed to the new Irish government in the south. While these are no allies of Collins and his IRA, the are still Republicans. Made up of avowed anti-syndicalists and supporters of the National Centre Party and Fianna F�il who have been forced underground. If we were to help arm and organise these disparate groups into an 'Irish National Army' it would greatly increase our chances of success, but would upset members of the loyalist militias who wish for a return of the monarchy to Ireland as well as members of our armed forces for whom the memories of the Irish War are not easily forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_890004_DESC;After successfully ousting the Liberal's from office, the new Coalition government quickly set about the task of producing their own defence bill. Bill C-8 as it is known, was heavily influenced by the British Exiles, prioritising conscription as well as increasing the ability of Canada's security forces to deal with any perceived left wing infiltration. The SocCred coalition partners focused on the nationalisation of certain key industries in preparation for the future implementation of Social Credit policy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_890025_DESC;Social Credit is an economic philosophy that was developed by Clifford Hugh Douglas during the Weltkrieg, believing that the current economic system was designed to create a plutocracy through unnecessary scarcity and that the workers needed to be freed from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production. Douglas' reform program containted two main elements, a national dividend to distribute money equally to all citizens to bridge the gap between earning power and prices, and a price adjustment mechanism that would forestall the possibility of inflation. Now that we are in power, we can work to implement these ideas throughout the nation. However critics have accused Social Credit of being 'syndicalistic' and as such it would perhaps be wise to moderate our plans lest they draw anger.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_890027_DESC;The Imperial Broadcasting Service was founded by Sir John Reith in 1926 after the British Revolution, when his previous broadcasting organisation, the British Broadcasting Corporation founded in 1922 after the Weltkrieg, was taken over by the Syndicalists. The broadcasting service has proved invaluable in promoting loyalty throughout the British Empire towards our common goal of reviving the United Kingdom as well as marginalising Syndicalism within our borders. After the debacle over Bill C-7 there have been calls to begin a propaganda campaign against more moderate socialists who it has been claimed are at fault for 'sabotaging' the bill. Others, noting increasing international tensions, have suggested aligning our propaganda towards a more external focus to prepare our people for the coming fight against Syndicalism.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_1010211_DESC;It was often said that India had been the vessel that kept British economic power pumping. However, the war between the Indian states and the disrepair of the merchant marine have all been deciding factors in crippling our proud nation�s potential for foreign trade. Rare materials, jute, cloth and exotic foodstuffs (and above all - tea!) are all in high demand throughout the world, promising us the possibilities of a vast influx of revenue.

EVT_1010222_DESC;As trade between the newly unified Indian subcontinent and the rest of the world begins to accelerate, the security of Indian shipping has become a most urgent matter.

EVT_890040_DESC;Today influential figure in pre-revolutionary Britain's politics and long-time prime minister of British government in-exile, Stanley Baldwin, resigned from his mostly ceremonial office after the meeting with His Majesty in which Edward VIII notified the prime minister of his intention to marry his mistress, princess Isabelle of Orleans. While it's true that the prime minister opposed the idea of marriage on the ground of religion of king's love interest, and the fact that His Majesty's father did not agree to his son's marriage with the princess back in 1930, after the death of her first husband, sources close to the royal court indicate that real reason of resignation lies in new king ignoring Mr. Baldwin's advice in favour of Winston Churchill and Lord Beaverbrook, formerly ministers in Lord Curzon's government. Edward VIII accepted the resignation and later this day appointed Lord Beaverbrook as new prime minister of government in-exile.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_890041_DESC;After long preparations His Majesty has finally wed princess Isabelle of Orleans today during a lavish ceremony taking place in Ottawa, accompanied by several head of states (or their representatives), including presidents Hoover and P�tain, Haakon VII of Norway, Christian X of Denmark, George II of Greece, archduke Felix of Austria and grand duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia. Princess Isabelle, daughter of Orleanist pretender, met His Majesty, at the time prince of Wales, during his visit to Algiers shortly before the British Revolution of 1925, and managed to catch his attention with her intelligence, linguistical abilities, and first-hand experience of Great War, during which she served as a nurse. Prince and princess met again in 1927, and shortly after began their not-so-well hidden affair, despite princess Isabelle being married and already a mother. While His Majesty didn't manage to manage to convince his father, king George V, to allow him to marry princess Isabelle after her first husband's death in 1930, he appeared with her on several occasions after she moved to Canada in late 1930. During the time princess managed to win the people's support, especially in Quebec area, which proved to be very valuable for His Majesty tirelesly fighting for improving image of the monarchy.

EVT_90523_DESC;Despite the decision of the government to limit naval spending that ultimately lead to the Coastal Strikes of 1934, the Kaiserliche Marine stands as the strongest navy in the world in the year 1936. Today, the Reichskanzler faces a decision: whether to continue the naval construction plan started by Reichskanzler von Tirpitz, or to cease construction altogether. Critics from military circles, the Deutsche Vaterlandspartei and the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei point out that it�s likely that many challenges will face the Marine in the coming years. The expansionist Empire of Japan and resurgent Commune of France both are key future enemies to unseat German naval superiority across the world � and the German Empire can�t afford to look weak. On the other hand the Zentrum Party, remaining in uneasy alliance with von Westarp�s DKP, demands ending the construction, arguing that balancing the budget is even more important. Choosing either option will result in various political ramifications, as well as military ones.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_90524_DESC;The Chancellor predicted that decision to continue the naval construction program will cause political fallout, but couldn�t have expected that it would be so severe. In yesterday�s speech the Chairman of the Zentrumspartei, Heinrich Br�ning, announced that his party had found itself in a position in which it can no longer support von Westarp�s government. Although the leader of the largest party in the Reichstag expressed hope for continued cooperation with the DKP in the future, he also made it clear that it will only be possible with another chancellor in power, preferably one from the Zentrum. Initially von Westarp, informed by the Kaiser about his continued support for the government, hoped to secure a majority in the Reichstag by joining forces with the right-wing faction of DVLP lead by Graf Hans-J�rgen von Blumenthal and regionalists from the BVP, but his hopes were thwarted when during the today�s meeting with Carl Friedrich Goerdeler he was informed about the discontent in the DKP�s parliamentary faction. Ultimately the chancellor, unsure about his own party�s and popular support, decided to resign. Accompanied by Prince Eitel Friedrich and Prince Oskar Kuno, von Westarp announced his resignation during a meeting with the media and called for a swift appointment of his successor.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_90525_DESC;The DVLP and DAP always saw Chancellor von Westarp as weak. The same can be said about the ambitious Reichskriegsminister, General Kurt von Schleicher, for whom the decision to stop the naval construction program was the straw that broke the camel's back. Yesterday the Minister of War began to implement his plan to topple von Westarp�s government. At first he fed hardliners in the DKP a rumor that in preparation for a Zentrum-DKP coalition in future, the Reichstag government will start distributing land to unemployed workers, then he made sure that left-wing media properly covered the story about the end of the construction program, and finally he went to see the Kaiser. Denounced as an �agro-bolshevik� in the Reichstag by Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau, the Chancellor was just beginning to grasp the size of the problems he had found himself in when he was called to the Berliner Stadtschloss. He was informed by His Imperial Majesty that the government had lost his support, and was given the opportunity to resign rather than be dismissed.

EVT_90527_DESC;"In 1932, after the resignation of Chancellor von Hutier, General von Schleicher tried and failed to persuade the Kaiser to appoint Alfred Hugenberg as his successor. However, since 1932 the Reichskriegsminister�s influence in the army and in the royal court rose directly in proportion to his ambitions. When talks between influential figures of German politics began after the fall of von Westarp, it seemed that the emergence of a broad, right-wing coalition with ""The Lion of Africa"" Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck at its helm was almost certain. All that remained was ensuring the support of at least part of Zentrum or DAP � and that is when von Schleicher decided to strike. Supported by the Kronprinz, he argued that von Lettow-Vorbeck doesn�t have the necessary experience, especially in the field of foreign politics, and that his rule over Mittelafika shows that he subscribes to some of the ideas presented by suspicious elements within the FVP and SPD. Von Schleicher suggested Franz von Papen, Foreign Minister in von Westarp�s government, could keep the DKP-NLP coalition in place and appease the Catholics, and maybe even take control over the right wing of the Zentrumspartei. Von Schleicher's gamble succeeded - today His Imperial Majesty decided to surprise the Reichstag and public opinion by appointing Franz von Papen, former member of the Zentrum party (currently independent), as the 11th chancellor of German Empire.";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_90520_DESC;"Unfortunately, the damage was already done. Political instability caused by the fall of von Westarp combined with the fear of changes in Commune of France and Russia made investors rapidly withdraw their assets.

As soon as the stock market opened, panic selling erupted, and it took well into the night for the teleprinters to stop sputtering out the results of what became known as ""der Schwarz Montag"".

EVT_830138_DESC;A brilliant strategist and fervent monarchist, John Frederick Charles Fuller has spent the years after the Entente's defeat in the Weltkrieg developing a new set of land doctrines based on speed, mechanization and combined arms doctrines. Inspired by the experiences of the Russian civil war and the nascent British tank corps, Fuller has now finalized his ideas and presented it to the new field marshal. Shall we tread this new path of armoured warfare and incorporate his proposed Mobile Division?;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_1100300_DESC;Having at long last taken control of the Commune, the Jacobin led Comit� de Salut Public is now divided. Hardliners are demanding that the Syndicalist structures be abolished, all replaced by the Parti Communiste Fran�ais in a Bolshevik-Lenninist state. However, this is likely to viciously divide France and as such many members of the party are suggesting that the Jacobins continue to operate within the established Syndicalist structures of the BGT & CSP while gradually reforming the state along 'true' Marxist lines.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1100304_DESC;Now the leading Travailleur figure, L�on Blum has begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities. Fearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements G�n�raux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominetly other than Blum himself, the still respected general Maurice Gamelin.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1100305_DESC;The various leading figures of the Front Populaire, as well as other prominent potential allies of theirs, such as Maurice Gamelin have been arrested and are being tried for treason. The Paris Trial aimed to prove that Blum and his associates had undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defenses against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin remained silent throughout, refusing to recognise the courts right to try him. The trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unoficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendents regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_1100311_DESC;The extremist Jacobin faction has driven the illigitimate Commune to the precipice. The socialists fight amongst themselves as France burns. The traitor general Maurice Gamelin failed to overthrow the Communist at the first attempt and was forced to retreat south. We have received word that via secret channels that Gamelin is willing to recognise our Republic in return for aid in defeating the Jacobins. Although considered one of the worst traitors France has ever seen for leading the reds in the first civil war which saw us reduced to our exile in Algiers, this could be our best chance to return home and drive out the craven Communards that stole it from us.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_210242_DESC;Established in the aftermath of the British Revolution of 1925, the Union of Britain is a decentralised state ruled by directly elected regional councils under the jurisdiction of a national Trade Unions Congress (TUC). Having seen the difficulties apparent in France's attempts at complete nationalization and collectivization, the current British ethos is not one of an entirely state directed economy - instead the TUC prefers to allow economic freedom at the local level backed up by strong workers' rights, welfare support and a democratization of the workplace in the form of co-operatives as both the private and public company are banned as forms of business organization. Major industrial concerns are nationalized and run by their respective Trade Unions with supervision from the Congress. The chairman of the TUC is the nominal head of state, but the government is generally seen by British citizens as a collective entity - decisions are made by voting for a simple majority and all unions are committed to respecting the majority ruling. Representatives are elected to the TUC by direct elections standing as nominally independent candidates, though in practice most coalesce in groups around certain ideals despite political parties being banned as formal organizations.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_210243_DESC;On this tenth day of the Trades Union Congress, the topic of debate has moved to the internal policy of the Union.  The different factions have put forwards their own views, but as of yet no single grouping seems to dominate the debate.  Will the Autonomist calls for decentralisation and home rule be recognised, perhaps the Maximist cries for centralisation and a strong executive could dominate the debate.  Or will the more vague promises to maintain the status quo presented by the Federationists and Congregationalists carry the day?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_104093_NAME;Remembrance Day;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_104093_DESC;All across Canada, and the British Empire, memorial services are held on this day at the 11th hour in memory of those fallen in the last Great War. This ceremony has taken on an ever greater public status in Canada since 1925, as the nation and Empire mourn not just the dead of the Weltkrieg but the loss of the Home Isles to Syndicalist Revolution. In Churches and town halls throughout the country, Canadians of all stripes are reminded of old struggles and encouraged to endeavour forward, to right past wrongs...;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_750003_DESC;The Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army and old enemy of President Kerensky, Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov has finally seized power, using army troops placed in Petrograd. However, he also understands that without an efficient political programme, his control over the country will be lost and the left Social-Revolutionaries will plunge Russia into terror and chaos. The temporary prime-minister, General Lukomsky, a well-known supporter of Kornilov can mantain a similarity of order, but he has awful relations with almost all republican factions in the Senate and Duma. As a result, Kornilov has decided to invite Boris Savinkov, the leader of 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii' (People's Republican Party of Russia), into the government and offer him the post of Prime-Minister. Though Savinkov and Kornilov are not on the best of terms, Kornilov hopes that Savinkov will be able to reconstruct the glory of the Russian state.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_758550_DESC;With the passing of Lavr Kornilov, Boris Savinkov and his radical NRPR supporters have managed to assume control over the entire country. The most important politician in the largest country of the world, Savinkov is hailed as the undisputed Vozhd (leader) of Russia and is ready to enforce his own ideology, which opposes both Syndicalism and the new Russian republican traditions, on the nation. The aim of this ideology, called 'National Renewal' is to reconstruct the Russian state into an entity capable of defending Russian interests and citizens all over the world. Savinkov won't stoop to dependency on either Mitteleuropa nor on the defeated Entente - his new Russia will be stronger than any alliance in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_758556_DESC;Boris Savinkov, a former terrorist and socialist turned populist and nationalist and protector of the Russian peasants in the Duma, has played a very important role in Russian politics since the end of the civil war. Between the years 1917-1920 he gained control over the rightist part of the Social-Revolutionary Party and renamed it the 'People`s Republican Party of Russia', which under his leadership did its best to fight separatism throughout the country, propose radical laws to improve the position of the peasants and support pro-Russian movements in the German satrapies, carved out of the territories of the former Russian Empire by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. A talented writer, as well as the leader of the Combat Squads in the different Russian cities and towns, Savinkov is ready to accept the role of the Kornilov`s supporter and to start rebuilding the Russian society on the basis of his ideology of National Renewal.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_758557_DESC;During a meeting of the left SRs in Moscow, Maria Spiridonova was assassinated by members of Savinkov�s Combat Squads. The liquidation of such a prominent Socialist leader provoked an early and consequently ill-organized rebellion against the government. The rising was easily suppressed by a concert of the police and Combat Squads. Today, General Kornilov published a new law prohibiting the Left SR party and proscribing its leaders. With the flower of its leadership cut down by the scythe of the state, the Social Revolutionaries no longer pose any threat to the Kornilov-Savinkov dyarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_758559_DESC;Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, supreme commander in chief and president of Russia passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. With Kornilov gone nothing stands in the way for Savinkov merging the posts of prime minister and president and thus becoming unassailable in his rulership over Russia. The merger was approved by a dubious plebiscite where more than 90 percent of the electorate voted �Da� (Yes). Savinkov now rules a potent and aggravated nation, ready to shed itself of the many humiliations faced since the Weltkrieg and step into the sun once more. The Vozhd commands!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_758560_DESC;With the merger of the offices of president and prime minister, Boris Savinkov continued to solidify his grip over the Russian State by penning Directive No. 1 (also known as the first �Vozhd-komanda�). Amongst other things, the directive dismissed the Duma and Senate whilst outlawing all political parties besides Savinkov�s own 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii'. Furthermore, the directive raised the Combat Squads to the status of a state organization and a full-blown branch of the government.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_758561_DESC;Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, supreme commander in chief and president of Russia passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. Two cliques are poised to seize control after Kornilov�s passing. The first, led by marshal Denikin, favours continued authoritarian military rule solidified by strong traditionalism. In opposition stands the young officers of Baron Wrangel. By no means a liberal, the Baron, however, knows that Russia must modernize and the societal issues of the state be resolved by a certain amount of governmental pragmatism.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_758562_DESC;Marshal Denikin has seized the apparatus of state from his rivals within the military junta! An avowed traditionalist, Denikin is determined to keep the military�s influence in its zenith as a bulwark against the dangers of degenerate socialism. However, some sort of political platform would be useful in securing the survival of a proper order in Russia and as such, it has been proposed that the military restore the Romanov dynasty as a national focal point.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_758564_DESC;As the power of the NRPR continues to expand into every crevice of the state, the Vozhd is faced with the prospect of handling the many disloyal elements who continue to frolic throughout the country. Consequently, the party chairman and the minister of internal security have proposed that the old Tsartist Katorga system of deporting political dissidents to labour camps in Siberia be reintroduced on a massive industrial scale in an effort to curtail the spread of degenerating counter-national propaganda.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_758565_DESC;The death of Maria Spiridonova prevented possible riots of the left SRs, but the situation in the country is still troublesome. Though some of the socialist ideas are implemented in the ideology of Savinkov's party, the radical syndicalists, who have the majority in some Russian regions, reject the ideals of the national state. However, it looks like the new government has many loyalists in the others circles of the Russian society. Old friends of Savinkov, the famous philosopher Dmitry Merezhkovsky and his wife Zinaida Gippius have published an appeal to the new leaders of the country. They claimed that Russia must be purified from the internal enemies, who want to spread the chaos and to betray the national interests.

EVT_62130078_DESC;The newest storyline of Georges 'Herge' Remi's comic takes place in the Qing Empire. where the reporter Tintin is sent to dismantle a drug trafficking ring. It is known that Herge was helped in his work by a young student from the legation city of Shanghai named Zhang Chongren, who came to Flanders-Wallonia to study fine arts. The expertise of Zhang led to a striking and realistic representation of Chinese society and contributed greatly to the enormous success of the book in Mitteleuropa and in China. The book criticizes the weakness and the corruption of the Qing government as well as the Japanese occupation of Manchuria and is thus banned in both of these countries.

EVT_1_DESC;Egypt during the Weltkrieg was a British colony and as such it was forced to join in a war that it did not care for. It�s leader Abbas II was removed by the British and the abuses of colonial officers were ignored in the name of the war effort. Though spared fighting on their soil, Egyptians faced martial law, rising food prices, and strikes in Alexandria and Cairo in 1918. Hopes for greater autonomy were dashed when the war ended in 1921, as British military presence was expanded, and the sympathetic High Commissioner Wingate being replaced with a far stricter man. The late creation of a 1924 Constitution would see the nationalist Wafd party sweeping elections the following year, and events in faraway Britain would send shockwaves through Egyptian society. As revolution took hold in Britain, Cairo�s Tramway Workers launched a strike of their own, inspiring yet more Egyptians to strike and boycott. The situation would deteriorate for Britain, and by October of 1926 Egypt would be declared an independent nation. The Suez Canal would be lost however, as jealous German forces would seize it and threaten the nascent state with war if they tried to contest it. With few friends, and the threat of Ottoman sympathizers in the aristocracy and the old Khedive Abbas II, Sa�d Zaghlul would declare The Republic of Egypt. He and his party would dominate and secularize Egypt until his death in 1930, as Wafd would fall apart and his successor Nahhas would become massively corrupt. The collapse of the cotton industry in the late 1920s combined with the publishing of a �black book� of Nahhas�s corruption in 1934 would see General Aziz Ali al-Misri depose him.

EVT_2108_NAME;Ethiopia, an Empire at the Crossroads;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_2108_DESC;Ethiopia, also known as Abyssinia, was the only African state which managed to remain independent during the XIXth century Scramble for Africa, succesfully defeating an Italian invasion in 1896. This victory kickstarted the proccess of modernization in the Ethiopian Empire, in order to bring the country close to European standards regarding its economy, army and administration. In 1918, under empress Zauditu, the Ethiopian Empire entered the Weitkrieg on the side of the Germans, succesfully annexing the Italian colonies of Somaliland and Eritrea. Another sign of Ethiopia's modernization was the expansion of the DPAEB railroad, a vital transport link for the country. In 1930, Empress Zauditu died with no surviving children, which prompted her cousin Ras Tafari Makonnen to ascend the throne as Emperor Haile Selassie. The new monarch announced his intention to start a new series of reforms to bring Ethiopia 'into the west'. These initiatives, however, were fiercely opposed by the conservative nobility of the nation, who had been greatly strengthened by the annexation of the Italian colonies and the subsequent expansion of the army. Haile Selassie also faces opposition from the important Italian business community in Eritrea, who feel that any disturbance to the status quo will mean an end to their privileges. The imperial government, meanwhile, has suffered another blow in 1935, when a report by the German Ministry of Trade announced the fragile economical situation of the DPAEB, which puts the entire Ethiopian economy at risk - thus definitely proving the unefficiency of Ethiopia rallying to the German sphere. With an worldwide economical crisis approaching, Ethiopia may need to decide whether to continue its current relationship with Germany, seek new trade partners or pursue her own independent foreign policy.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_2109_NAME;Black Monday hits Ethiopia;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_2109_DESC;A major economical crisis has hit the German Empire. The Berlin Stock Exchange has hit an all-time low and, as a consequence, hundreds of enterprises across Europe are going bankrupt and millions of workers are left unemployed worldwide.

EVT_2110_NAME;The Panafricanist Movement;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_2110_DESC;A number of Ethiopian intelectuals, such as dr. Workneh Eshete and young diplomat Lorenzo Taezaz, have recently subscribed to the ideals of Panafricanism. The Panafricanist movement believes on the solidarity among the peoples of Africa and peoples of African descent throughout the world and cooperation against colonial exploitation. The particular interpretation of Panafricanism as promoted by dr. Eshete on his new book 'Africa in the 20th Century', puts a heavy emphasis on the role of Ethiopia, the only African country not subject to colonization by European powers, as the champion of African interests and a possible leader for the liberation of the continent.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_2111_DESC;The economical crisis of early 1936 has demonstrated the fragility of our current foreign trade system and the problems of our continuing relations with the German Empire. As part of the emperor's series of reforms in our country, we must rethink our diplomatic policies. Should we stick to our current approach of favouring our contacts with Germany and the Mitteleuropa system? Other powers, some as far away as Japan, also have interests in Ethiopia and would favour a deeper relationship with us. Or maybe we should listen to the excentric ideas of dr.

EVT_5000_DESC;Ever since the Arab Congress in Cairo fleshed out the ambitions of the Arab Bloc, the Arabian vilayets of the Ottoman Empire has been in turmoil.

EVT_5002_NAME;Exchanging Letters With the Emir of Jebel Shammar;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_5002_DESC;The various clans and emirates of Arabia all took different sides during the Weltkrieg and one of the most hotly contended was the Emirate of Jebel Shammar. The Rashidi emir Saud bin Abdulaziz remained neutral during the Arab Campaign and maintained cordial relations with the Turks, which allowed him to maintain a certain amount of autonomy from Istanbul. However, the Ottoman administration and authority has suffered greatly since the Arab Congress and bin Abdulaziz, opportunist to the very core, is starting to get worried what his fate would be once a successful Arab uprising displaces his Turkish overlords. Now might be a good time to offer, discretely of course, the emir a way out.;;;;;;;;;;x

ACTIONNAME_5008_A;This second Arab invasion shall be utterly crushed!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_5010_DESC;With the defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the emancipation of the Arabs by the Axis powers, the Hashemite dynasty has finally been vindicated and now rule large swaths of the Arab world. However, an Arab is not just an Arab as dozen upon dozen of different kinds of tribes, clans, religions and sects subdivide the proud Arabian people. It has been proposed that the emir capitalize on the prestige of the House of Hashim and proclaim himself Caliph of all Muslims as to strengthen the legitimacy of our new state. However, a majority of the military and civilian officials who fought with Feisal during the First and Second Independence Wars caution against such a move, insisting that the new age for Arabia requires a secular state centred on the Arab nation. His highness the Shariff will have to decide�;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_5013_DESC;The Shariffian state has expanded beyond the ravines of the Arabian peninsular, winning the House of Hashim new lands and cities. Consequently, the old legal and political structures of the kingdom no longer match the demographic landscape. Our victory has brought us urban centres of commerce, fertile lands for agriculture and scores of new tribal groupings as well as religious and ethnic minorities. The Emir�s privy council has been approached by a delegation of bourgeois dignitaries and tribal elders with the suggestion of convening a national convention to draft a new unifying constitution. This would certainly make the longevity of our state far more probable.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_5015_DESC;Given the stark contrasts between the various subjects living in the Hashemite domains, the assembly is extremely conscious of the trouble the issue of centralism could cause to the fragile unity of the Arabs. Some argue that we should enforce greater centralization and thus enhance the pace of modernization, thus speeding up the improvement of the life of our citizens considerably. Others hold the belief that the differences between the well-to-do merchant families in the port cities of the Levant and the nomade Bedus of the Arabian desert are too vast for a strictly structured state to function properly. Instead, these delegates ask that the kingdom grants its citizens wide cultural as well as religious freedoms.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_5016_DESC;A very important factor in the Arab victory over the Turkish menace was the aid of the various bedouin tribes. The bedu are a proud people with a strong identity centred on their nomadic way of life and as such they often clash with city dwellers who just can�t seem to fathom why relieving a few farmers of their goods and camels isn�t a very big deal. However, the world is changing and the question is if it wouldn�t be better for the bedouins if they were persuaded to settle permanently.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_5018_DESC;Known as the Sharifian Army or the Arab Northern Army, the military forces of the House of Hashim fought doggedly against the Turks in the liberation of Arabia from Ottoman tyranny. However, as a unit - the army is a brittle thing, having stayed united only through the threat of the lumbering Turkish menace. Thus as a consequence of our victory, the many irregulars of our army has begun to disband, taking their plunder and glory with them. If we are to maintain our independence the Arab state needs a strong army - a Grand Arab Army. Whether or not such a new force should be a professional unit or an army of conscripts has still not been decided.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_11000_DESC;"Ever since the end of the Weltkrieg, officials in both Berlin and Dar Es Salaam have had designs about expansion of the Freistaat Mittelafrika. Most of those plans involved the annexation of the Portuguese colonies in Africa, most notably Angola and Mozambique - true geopolitical anomalies, foreign enclaves within a mighty and huge German colonial holding. Only the Peace with Honour accords, which preserved the colonial empires of the Entente powers after the Great War, has prevented the annexation of these territories. During the 1920s and the early 1930s, Berlin officially abandoned these expansion plans and instead started to rebuild good relations with Portugal. But since the ascension of Hermann Goering as governor of Mittelafrika in 1932, everything has changed. He secretly harbours the desire to personally ""correct"" the existence of the Portuguese colonial empire and expand Mittelafrika, which he sees as his personal dominion. However, without some kind of pretext that would allow him to justify an expansion of Mittelafrika before Secretary of the German Colonial Office Wilhelm Solf and the Reichstag, both reluctant to spend Germany's limited resources, he will never be allowed this.

Slave trading and the export of spices were the primary sources of income. Between 1789 and 1805 rivalries for the throne between factions within the Al Sa'id Dynasty precluded Oman's demise. More and more it came under the influence of the British Empire without ever becoming a formal colony. During this feud, Muscat on the sea formed a sultanate while the inner country became a religiously oriented imamate. The growing dominance of the British increased the political and economic dependency of Oman. Not only had they lost the rich island of Sansibar to the British, in exchange for which they received the Sansibar Subsidy, but the opening of the Suez Canal and the prohibition of slave and weapons trade had completely crippled their economy. This changed after the Weltkrieg. The 1925 British Revolution threw both Britain and nearby India into chaos.  Oman became free from British influence and was even able to annex the so-called ""Trucial States"", previously under British protection. But Oman�s struggled in the decade since.

EVT_15000_DESC;Welcome to Kaiserreich�s Ottoman Empire! A country racked by domestic turbulence the Sublime State is currently in a very difficult position. However, fear not! Reform is still possible. \n \n The nature of reform is, however, a divided issue and three political groupings vie for mastery of the beleaguered Empire. In control of the government sits the Ottoman People's Party consisting of reformists led by the grand vizier, Mustafa Kemal. The Freedom and Accord Party (Liberals and pro-minority politicians under Prince Mehmed Sab�haddin) remain a vocal opposition group and staunch proponents of ecumenical Ottomanism. Lastly, the Turanist Party (Pan-Turkists and all-round reactionaries under Yusuf Ak�ura and Nihal Atsiz) keep agitating for Turkish primogeniture. You�ll face several different political issues such as the Arab problem, army reform and the quest for economic recovery. Each of these events will have choices favoured by either of the three factions that influence the strength of the growing reform movement within the Ottoman parliament. There are 288 seats in the Ottoman chamber of deputies and if the country is to survive you need the backing of at least 150 members. \n�RIt is suggested that you stay clear of the most extreme options if �Ryou fancy keeping the empire from imploding. �RThe choice is, of course, �Rall yours. Good luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15001_DESC;Today marks the 20th anniversary of the great Ottoman victory at Gallipoli. Effectively repulsing the Entente attempt at forcing the Dardanelles and seizing Istanbul, the victory at Gallipoli remained the one of the only major military success of the Porte during the Weltkrieg and paved the way for the commanding officer, Mustafa Kemal Pasha�s career as Grand Vizier. Speaking at ANZAC Cove, Mustafa Kemal spoke to both Ottoman as well as invited Australasian soldiers and officials to Gallipoli and remarked that, \n \n "There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours ... You, the mothers who sent their sons from faraway countries, wipe away your tears, your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well." \n \n His remarks moved both Ottoman and Australiasian delegations greatly. Throughout the empire parades, celebratory manifestations and speeches are held, fostering a rare example of state-patriotism shared by our subjects - be they Turk, Kurd or Arab.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15002_DESC;A Tartar immigrant from the Russian Empire and a leading figure within the Ottoman intelligentsia, Yusuf Ak�ura passed away today at his palatine mansion in Istanbul. Besides his work as a journalist and academic, Ak�ura was highly influential within the Pan-Turkist (also known as Turanist) Movement - being regarded by some as the unofficial leader of the grouping. His place in the Ottoman parliament has been filled by the young Nihal Atsiz who alongside Sadri Maksudi Arsal, Ethem Nejat and the disgraced field marshal Enver Pasha are expected to assume leadership over the Pan-Turkists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15008_DESC;Although the Arab Revolt led by Sharif Hussein and his many sons ultimately failed to realize the dream of single greater Arabia under Hashemite rulership, the very fact that the Ottoman government was forced to acknowledge the Shariffian state�s independence meant that the flame of Arab nationalism, although dimmed, was allowed to flicker on. At a recent congress in Cairo, the independent Arab states led by Egypt and the Hashemite kingdom have concluded a pact to actively work for the separation of our Arab vilayets and their ascension to either of the irredentist Arab states. Although some level of rapprochement between the Turkish and Arab parts of our empire has happened since 1921, the aggressive rhetoric of the nationalists threatens to destroy this hard-won amiability. The government must address the issue of Arab separatism, lest the vilayets of Syria and Iraq degenerate into sedition and civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15009_DESC;A dominating issue of Ottoman politics since the First Balkan War, the status of the many minorities (Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians, Kurds and Arabs, to name the major ethnicities) has steered the Empire into many tragic events through the last twenty years. \n \n Consequently, the various political groupings at court have very varied attitudes towards addressing the problem. Kemal Pasha�s Serenity of the Ottomans Party maintain that a vague definition of Ottomanism of equal rights for all the Sultan�s subjects (though under Turkish leadership) is the way to go, whilst the Liberals advance the claim that the running of the empire must become completely egalitarian for all ethnicities and religious groupings. The Rumeli Party vehemently argue that only the Turkish race is suited for controlling the future of the Ottoman state and that all minorities become completely subservient to its Pan-Turanist ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15010_DESC;The recent enforcement of martial law in the Arab provinces and the Ottoman government�s anti-minority policies have caused great unrest in the Kurdish-majority vilayets in eastern Anatolia. Although loyal to the Caliph, the Kurdish magnates have been greatly angered by the lack of toleration shown by Constantinople and are demanding greater local autonomy. This is of course seen as completely impossible by both the Serenity of the Ottomans and the Rumeli Party.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15014_DESC;At the onset of the Weltkrieg, the Ottoman Army quickly adapted the doctrines and tactical modus operandi of its German allies. However, Mustafa Kemal Pasha orchestrated the defense of Anatolia and eventual Ottoman counter offensive according to the tenets of the Grand Battle Plan doctrine. As a result of the conflicting theories, the Ottoman high command (the Kararg�h) hasn�t been able to properly reform the structures of the army. The government must make a decision, but there are other doctrines at play and Kazim Karabekir Pasha is actively lobbying for complete motorization and investments into armour formations. However, such a bold move would certainly not benefit the stability of the empire�s reforms...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15015_DESC;The Ottoman Army had entered the Weltkrieg with many shortcomings and left it completely broken. Thanks to a massive national effort the armed forces of the House of Osman arose from their traumatic experiences in the Levant under the watchful eye of Kemal Pasha and a somewhat robust army was consequently established. However, deep mistrust had permeated the Empire�s Turkish and Arab citizens as a great amount of Arab officers and enlisted-men defected to the British and Sharifian forces. Subsequently, a tight quota on Arab cadets in the Empire�s military schools was enforced, but many believe that this policy has become detrimental to the unity of the empire. Should we rescind the restrictions on minorities in the officer corps?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15017_DESC;Hailed as a patriot and a war hero famous for his exploits on the Libyan front as a cavalry officer, prince Osman Fuad utilized a recent memorial event held for the late general Izzet Pasha to declare his full support for the revitalization of the ideals of Ottomanism. Being a close friend of the current grand vizier Kemal Pasha, the Prince�s speech has been perceived by many as clear show of support for the reformist ideals brought forward by his good friend Kemal Pasha.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_15020_DESC;It is said that Napoleon once remarked that the port of Antwerp in the hands of a great continental power could constitute a loaded gun leveled at the English coast. \n \n In the time immediately preceding the Weltkrieg it was thought in England that a strong German or Ottoman presence in Baghdad would amount to a 42-centimeter cannon aimed at the British Raj. Thus the completion of the Baghdad railway served as a major point of contention between the British and the Central Powers and ultimately helped pave the road for war between the great powers. After years of negotiations and the bankrolling of investments from Mitteleuropa and America, the railroad is finally ready for completion and only the very last amount of cash is needed from the Ottoman government. However, some within the government believe that the funds should be spent on alleviating the citizens of the Empire suffering from the ongoing economic crisis. This would certainly improve the empire�s current stability, but weaken the unity of the state in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15021_DESC;Grave news. A few days ago, delegates from Egypt and the rogue Shariffian state signed a military pact in Cairo aimed at constituting... �an axis on which the issue of Arab liberation and emancipation shall rotate�. The irredentist goals of these two powers have long been known to the Ottoman government, but the signing of an official military alliance directly dedicated to the mutilation of our Empire is a truly worrisome development. Something will have to be done...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15023_DESC;The first Ottoman labour code was instituted by the decree of grand vizier Kemal Pasha in order to counter the threat of Syndicalist influence in the nascent workers� movement. Although the empire is still far from a completely modern industrialized society, certain parts of the industry, such as the tobacco sector, had seen a steady increase in production and income in the years prior to the Weltkrieg. With our economy still feeling the effects of Black Monday some business owners are starting to lay off workers and disregard what few rights the weak trade unions have managed to scrape together. It is suggested that the government force through a new labour code to secure the support of the industrial workers. This could help the reform movement thoroughly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15024_DESC;The Ottoman state was never particularly modernized when it came to the construction of railroad networks. Camel caravans are frequently seen ferrying goods across the Anatolian highlands in lieu of weak infrastructure. With the Mesopotamian vilayets now strengthened by the final completion of the Baghdad Railway, it is now suggested by the reformist movement that we finance the enlargement of the railnet in Anatolia - the heartland of the Ottoman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15025_DESC;Founded in 1881 the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (OPDA) was an European-controlled organization that monitored and collected debt owed by the Ottoman State to European creditors in the private and public sectors. Most of the debt had been owed to French and British government as well as private institutions and had as a consequence been unilaterally been defaulted by the Ottoman government when revolution swept away the regimes in London and Paris. However, the OPDA is still in existence and is now controlled by German and Austrian administrators, mainly concerned with regaining the capital loaned to Istanbul during the Weltkrieg.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15026_DESC;The eastern reaches Anatolia have since the beginning of time been considered an unruly country where the grasp of the state is difficult to feel. To combat this the Sublime Porte has hitherto been forced to resort to arming various Kurdish tribal groupings in the eastern mountains to keep the peace. However, these tribes only maintain some small degree of order and the expenditures combined with the lax taxation of the region have proven a considerable constraint on our state finances. It has been suggested that we reform the rural gendarmerie and increase its funding and amount of officer cadets, in order for the state to obtain firmer control with the troublesome region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15027_DESC;The border regions of the Syrian and Arab deserts have always been hard to exert political dominion over given the nomadic structure of the bedouin clans inhabiting the area. The Ottoman government has since the 18th century been paying various tribal groupings to patrol the fringes in order to combat rogues and bandits preying on the local populace as well as the Hajj pilgrims returning from Mecca. However, it might be in the interest of the state if we were to abolish the stipend-based bedouin protection of the region and instead form an official government-controlled camel corps to keep the peace between the bedu tribes and safeguard the pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15028_DESC;The Committee of Union of Progress was dissolved with force shortly after the Weltkrieg and its members scattered into exile and political disgrace. However, the remnant members of the CUP eventually formed into the Progress and Renewal Party wherefrom they continued to exert some influence over the state thanks to the party�s powerful paramilitary forces and moderate support in the civil service. As the reform movement attempts to galvanize the Ottoman Empire, the grand vizier now hopes to finally rid himself of the threat posed by the Unionist remnant. However, this could prove exceptionally dangerous - since the CUP has shown time and time again that they covet the leadership of the state beyond everything and will go to any length to take it back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15029_DESC;Originally instigated by sultan Abdulmejid I in 1849 during the first Tanzimat reforms, the Oath Against Bribery was solemn a vow taken by all officers at state to refuse and combat all attempts at bribing them. Abandoned after the failure of the Tanzimat experiment corruption has since become intolerable and outright rampant, especially in the most distant parts of the Empire. The government is now contemplating having another Abdulmejid institute the oath and thus link incorruptibility with loyalty towards the Sublime Porte. Paradoxically enough, such a move could very well weaken the position of the ruling Serenity of the Ottomans Party since its members in all levels of governance are most likely to benefit from the steady income provided by such underhand dealings. However, the oath will surely benefit the reformation of the Ottoman Empire...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15030_DESC;Undoubtedly the greatest Ottoman to have lived in the modern era, Mustafa Kemal Pasha paid dearly for his untiring work in restoring the splendour of the Sublime Porte. Having been ill for a prolonged time, the grand vizier finally succumbed to the strain of governance and passed away last night at his official residence in Istanbul. With the nation in mourning, the Sultan has convened the Chamber of Deputies to assert what political party carries the most influence and will appoint a new grand vizier from that faction. However, a successful transfer of power solely depends on the strength of the reform movement...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15038_DESC;The Tanzimat (Turkish for �reorganization�) Period was a series of reform perpetuated by the Ottoman government in the hopes of stalling the decline of the Empire in the later half of the 19th century. \n \n With the Ottoman state sufficiently bolstered by the reforms undertaken in the last few years, the incumbent government is now ready to embark on an ambitious further wave of reform that should conclusively consolidate the Sublime Porte. Although the Ottoman Empire has weathered the economic crisis of 1936 and diffused the secessionist ambitious of the Arab populace further reform is necessary and the time is rapidly approaching for a reckoning with the scheming Hashemites and their Egyptian backers... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15039_DESC;Introduced in March 1913 under the auspices of the Young Turk government, the Law of the Vilayets had organized the Ottoman state into a Napoleonic administrative structure of centrally managed departments with very little room for provincial autonomy. \n \n The law had thus quashed Arab hopes for further decentralization and contributed significantly to the rising enmity between the empire�s Turkish and Arab subjects. Now, however, it has been proposed by the Freedom and Accord Party that a new provincial structure be created more accommodating to the diverse nature of the Ottoman state. The legislature would include making Arabic the official language of the Empire�s Arab provinces and secure different levels of autonomy for the various vilayets and sanjaqs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15041_DESC;The Ottoman Empire had always relied heavily on its agrarian economy, but its feudal nature became a point of contention as the Empire began to industrialize and the need for quality produce became urgent. Although certain government ordained decrees (regarding e.g. the tobacco industry) have reformed certain aspects of the agrarian industry, a lot of resentment still lingers in the peasant communities towards the autocratic nature of the so-called Agalik-system where farmers cultivate the soil on the behalf of the wealthy landed aristocrats knowns as Aghas. It has been suggested by the cabinet that the state initiate a series of reforms of the agrarian sector which would include land reform and investments in the new peasant small holders. This could solidify the Ottoman economy, but would also greatly upset the landed aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15042_DESC;Although steps have been taken in recent years to rectify the glaring doctrinal discrepancies within the Ottoman army structure the equipment with which the Porte�s troops are supposed to fight with are sadly of a very archaic quality. Thus the high command has proposed that we invest considerable resources in rearming our troops with modern equipment and munitions. Such an investment would also prove beneficial to the wider economic reconstruction which makes the idea very popular throughout the apparatus of state. However, our immediate neighbours certainly won�t like the rearmament of the mighty Ottoman Army...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15043_DESC;Feeling the heat of the Ottoman government�s ban on its paramilitary forces and the dismissal of civil servants loyal to the movement, the Committee of Union and Progress remnant in the Progress and Renewal Party utilized the quietness of the small hours to launch a coup to dislodge the staggering and weakening reform movement.

EVT_15044_DESC;As the rebel troops made their way to the Sultan�s quarters at the Dolmabahce palace, a gun fight broke out between the CUP-putchists and Abd�lmecid�s life-guards. Desperately trying to force the Sultan to surrender and accept the demands of the coup-leaders, the rebels became restless and resumed firing at the entrenched and outnumbered loyalists. In the ensuing fire-fight the Sultan-Caliph was mortally wounded and only lived for a very short amount of time. As the rebel troops searched the royal quarters they came upon crown prince Ahmed Nihad whom they at gun-point declared to be Sultan Ahmed IV. However, the grand vizier has not been caught and there�s rumours of unrest at the Ertugrul Cavalry barracks�;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_15045_DESC;As smoke bellowed from the burning Dolmabahce palace and news spread around Istanbul of the attempted coup, prince Osman Fuad decided to act. \n \n Making his way to the Ertugrul Cavalry barracks, the prince quickly won the unit for the loyalists and led them on a charge against the putchist pickets at the war ministry. The trained royal guards made short work of the paramilitary forces of the Committee of Union and Progress and as further loyalist troops continued to arrive under the command of the grand vizier order was soon restored to the Ottoman capital. However, swift decisions are needed, if the state is too survive this criminal act and the vile murder of the Sultan-Caliph.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_17000_NAME;The Union of South Africa;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_17000_DESC;Formed in 1910 as a merger of the various British possessions in South Africa, the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal and the Orange Free State -  the Union of South Africa is currently a parliamentary Republic having seceded from the British Empire during the crisis of 1925. The British Revolution gave the anti-British coalition of the National and Labour Parties the opportunity to break free from British influence that they had been under since the end of the 2nd Boer War (1899-1902). The first President of South Africa, James Hertzog, used the chaos to annex the neighbouring British protectorates of South Rhodesia, Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland while leaving the remainder of Britain�s African colonies to fall into the hands of the German Freistaat.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_17001_NAME;The Peoples of South Africa;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_17001_DESC;South Africa is a divided nation. While the vast majority of the population belong to the various native ethnic African groups, socio-economic power is held by the white European minority. This in turn is divided between the Afrikaners - Dutch speaking decedents of the original Dutch colonists and the Boers who settled the Transvaal and Orange Free State - and the British, who form the majority of the white population in Natal and Rhodesia. The Cape Province is a melting pot of both Afrikaner and British, as well as being home to the majority of South Africa's Coloureds (people of mixed white and black ancestry). The country also houses a noticeable Indian presence, a legacy of the Empire. Considerable legislation exists limiting the rights of the non-white population - such as land ownership, required passports for internal movement within South Africa, segregation of urban districts etc.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_17002_NAME;The Union's Constitution;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_17002_DESC;South Africa's current constitution is an adaption of the 1909 South Africa Act. The Union of South Africa is a unitary state, rather than a federation, with each colony's parliaments abolished and replaced with provincial councils. The Parliament consists of two parts, the Volksraad and Senate. The Volksraad members are elected mostly by the country's white minority although the franchise varies depending upon the province, of which there are five - Cape, Natal, the Orange Free State, Transvaal and Rhodesia. In the Cape and Natal, a qualified franchise based upon property and education requirements is in place while the vote is white only in the remaining provinces. The Senate is appointed by an electoral college consisting of members of each of the five Provincial Councils and members of the Volksraad. Government follows the Westminster model, although with an elected President as head of state. South Africa continues to administer Bechuanaland, Lesotho and Swaziland as protectorates and while considerable legislation is in place restricting the rights of the native population within the Union, it has not been fully implemented in these territories.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_17003_NAME;The Death of Wilhelm Solf;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_17003_DESC;Wilhelm Solf has died. The first governor of Mittelafrika and long time Reich Secretary for the German colonies, Solf created most of Mittelafrika's laws and social security system, including the ban on forced labour. Many of these laws have been preventing Statthalter G�ring from exploiting the native labour force. The Reichskolonialamt might now be finally led by administrator more friendly to G�ring. By cutting social security, and reinstating forced labour, they will be able to cheaply exploit many new sources of income. This is sure to have repercussions in how we deal with our own native population.;;;;;;;;;;x

It also formed a number of other unions amongst people of colour.

EVT_17018_DESC;On the 3rd of February, the German stock market collapsed, plunging the world into depression. South Africa has relied on trade with Germany and its sphere of influence since the British Revolution and the declaration of the South African republic and withdrawal from trade with the remaining Entente. The crisis has had a terrible effect upon the South African economy, unemployment has risen markedly as many companies that depended upon the German export market go out of business or lay off white workers in favour of native labour.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME_17018_A;This is a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_17019_NAME;Dealing with the crisis;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_17019_DESC;The global economic crisis has hit South Africa hard. Our dependence on trade with Germany, long criticised by the pro British Dominion Party has seen deepening hardship take hold. However, the Volksraad is divided on how best to deal with the crisis. Cheap native labour is seen by many as the chief cause of unemployment and both the National Party and South African Labour Party are calling for further restrictions to be made upon native employment. The National Party also view an ambitious works program and an exploitation of the Protectorates could alleviate the situation while SA Labour feel socio-economic reform is key at this time. The Dominion Party points again to the dependence on Germany and seeks a liberalisation of the economy and a resumption of ties with the Entente and the Empire, although large tracts of Afrikaner society would balk at the prospect.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_17020_DESC;Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel Fran�ois Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They reject any compromise with either the British or the reds and believe that the best way to ensure the future of South Africa is to strengthen and expand the existing provincial segregation laws into a full nation-wide system, termed 'apartheid'.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_17021_NAME;Representation of Natives Act ;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_17021_DESC;Originally planned before the current economic crisis took hold, the Representation of Natives Act is meant to further solidify white political control in South Africa by repealing the Cape Qualified Franchise and it's similar counterpart in Natal that allows a small section of the native population to take part in elections. This would be done by taking natives out of the electoral rolls completely, with chiefs, local councils, urban advisory boards and election committees in all five provinces electing five whites to the Senate by a system of block voting. However, in this new political climate the more extreme wing of the party are advising we use this opportunity to appease our core electoral support, the Afrikaners by attacking part of our rival's the Dominionists, by proscribing Coloureds as well as natives. Such a move would draw the ire of the other sections of South African society and is something we are perhaps not ready for just yet. There is also the question of whether to establish a Native Representative Council, a move denounced by liberals who view it as an attempt to not just disenfranchise the natives but to separate them politically from our national polity.;;;;;;;;;;x

Unfortunately this militia clashed with local police who struggled to handle the larger than expected turnout.

These groups are further split into 13 nations or racial federations. White people encompassed the English and Afrikaans language groups; the black populace was divided into ten such groups. The Population Registration Act, requires that every South African be classified into one of these racial 'population groups'.

EVT_17118_DESC;Following the Population Registration Act, a series of laws came into force, collectively referred to as 'petty' Apartheid, as opposed to the 'greater' Apartheid planned by the Nationalist government. The first of these was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, prohibiting marriage between whites and people of other races. The Immorality Amendment Act forbade 'unlawful racial intercourse' and 'any immoral or indecent act' between a white and a black, Indian or coloured person. Transport and civil facilities were segregated. Education was strictly segregated, with universities established for the sole use of Xhosa, Zulu, Sotho, Coloured, Indians etc. The cumulative effect of this was to stratify society solidly along racial lines.;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVT_17119_DESC;The second stage of grand apartheid was the Group Areas Act. Until then, despite existing segregation law, most settlements had people of different races living side by side. This Act put an end to diverse areas and determined where one lived according to race. Each race was allotted its own area, which could be used as a basis for force eviction, allowing the government to demolish black shanty town slums and forced white employers to pay for the construction of housing for those black workers who were permitted to reside in cities otherwise reserved for whites.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_17120_DESC;Territorial separation was hardly a new institution in South Africa. There were, for example, the 'reserves' created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, the percentage of land reserved was increased from 8 to 13 percent to be used for black homelands, still a relatively small amount compared with the total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. These homelands or 'Bantustans' divided South Africa into a number of separate states, each of which is supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for the different ethnic groups. The practical effect of this legislation was to remove the citizenship of natives living within South Africa and reduce their status to that of migrant labour. The Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act abolished the remaining parliamentary representation for black people under the Representation of Natives Act, now represented by their own 'national' authorities.;;;;;;;;;;x

#South African Federation (U49)##;;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_21000_NAME;The End of the Union of South Africa;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21000_DESC;After careful negotiations we have convinced the Afrikaner dominated provincial councils to accept our proposed reforms and have agreed to allow the incorporation of the provinces of the Orange Free State and Transvaal into our new Federation. Despite having to make a number of concessions, we will now be able to pursue our goal of a united and federal South Africa where the rights of all it's citizens, regardless of race, are respected.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME_21000_A;Long live the Federation!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21001_NAME;The Political Structure of the Federation;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21001_DESC;The old unitary structure of South Africa, has been replaced by a federal model - the five old provinces (Cape, Natal, the Orange Free State, Transvaal and Rhodesia) have been joined by the three High Commission Territories of Bechuanaland, Basutoland and Swaziland to form the eight states of the Federation. The states have their own legislatures and premiers with considerable powers over socio-economic policy within the state, but there are limits imposed by the central federal government based in Cape Town. The major ones are the Natives Trust Act and the Qualified Franchise Act. ;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME_21001_A;Great!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21002_NAME;The Natives Trust Act;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21002_DESC;The Natives Trust Act provides for the existence of native administrated tribal land and grants a great deal of autonomy for them in addition to ensuring that a minimum of twenty percent of state land must be marked as such (previously this was only eight percent in the precursory Union reservations). The former Boer Republics of the Orange Free State and Transvaal keep at the minimum threshold with that figure rising in the British states and a majority of the High Commission Territories being given over to be governed by established Paramount Chiefs.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME_21002_A;KwaZulu!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21003_NAME;The Qualified Franchise Act;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21003_DESC;The Qualified Franchise Act requires all states use a derivative of the Cape Qualified Franchise in their elections, to ensure native representation and integration into the political process of South Africa. Again though, the extent this is implemented in the Afrikaner-dominant states is kept at the required minimum. Despite this, qualified franchise in the other states ensures that non-whites of at least 'middle class' wealth and education are eligible. This is most prominent in the Cape, where the qualified franchise is the most inclusive and full adult suffrage is granted to the Coloured & Asiatic populations. The same is true in Natal for the Asiatics, with the second largest franchise in South Africa.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME_21003_A;Great.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21004_NAME;The National Assembly, Senate & House of Lords;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21004_DESC;The Volksraad and Senate of South Africa have been reconstituted as the first two parts of a new tri-caramel parliament. The Volksraad, now the National Assembly, is the lower house and its members are elected from the local constituencies using local state franchise (varies state to state). The Senate is the first upper house, its members representing their states as a whole, the number of representatives each state is allocated is determined via their total electorate number, meaning that states with a larger electorate wield more power in the Senate as legislation is required to pass all three of the houses. This is set to seriously disadvantage the Afrikaner states, who, by keeping their franchise limited preserve their rights in-state while ceding influence on the Federation as a whole. The second upper house, the House of Lords, is a advisory council composed of hereditary native rulers. They have a limited veto unlike the Senate in a manner modelled on the old United Kingdom's Parliament, although they do have the right to legislate on matters that solely relate to the governance of the Native Trust land and have considerable influence in this area.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_21005_NAME;South Africa, the Entente and the Empire;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21005_DESC;With South Africa fully under our control we can now freely decide our stance towards the international community. A longstanding goal of the Dominion Party, the restoration of South Africa's ties to the British Empire is finally in our grasp. Despite the ever present protestations from the hardliners within the Afrikaner community, we are in a position at last to realise our goal. Shall we stand shoulder to shoulder with our brother-nations against the forces of German militarism and Syndicalist barbarism?;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_21008_NAME;The Restoration;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21008_DESC;We have been accepted back into the British Empire, the National Assembly today passing the Restoration Act - restoring the King's position as South Africa's head of state. While a coronation is not possible at this time, Edward VIII has been hailed as the monarch by all three houses of the South African Parliament. The former premier, Jan Smuts looks set to be appointed as Governor-General, however we now have to decide how much power that position can exercise on the Kings behalf. Many conservatives and liberals are advocating legally establishing the monarch as a figurehead, with his powers exercised by parliament, while nationalists are demanding Smuts, an Afrikaner, exercise the King's powers as Governor General.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME_21008_A;Legally establish the King as a figurehead!;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME_21008_B;Delegate the King's duties to the Governor-General.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21009_NAME;The Fate of the Dominionist Party;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21009_DESC;The Dominionist Party campaigned to restore the monarchy to South Africa and to reform the country into a new federation. Now that these goals have been achieved, ideological differences are beginning to fracture the party, with Hofmeyer's Progressives who seek to pursue a more liberal line in government, using federal powers to expand the franchise & social reform even further, and the Conservatives, still headed for now by Smuts. The Conservatives feel that the current reform of South Africa is sufficient and are reluctant to further encroach upon states� rights and do not wish the franchise expanded further. While these factions will continue to govern in coalition, the look set to form their own independent political parties in time to contest the next general elections in 1943, at which point the Dominionist Party would cease to exist.;;;;;;;;;;x

ACTIONNAME_21012_A;This is federal land now!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21013_NAME;The Armed Forces of the South African Federation;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_21013_DESC;Given the dangerous situation in the world and our newfound responsibilities as a Dominion of the British Empire, we shall need a much stronger military than the one that we currently possess. Therefore, we can take one of two routes in expanding the Federations armed forces. First, we could open up service to all citizens regardless of race, and actively encourage natives to join up. This would have the benefit of rapidly expanding the number of available recruits. Second, we could restrict the intake of non-white recruits, instead focusing upon making the South African Armed Forces one of the most elite in the Entente.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_56019_DESC;Now that our cowardly enemies are defeated nobody can stop our Khan from restoring the past glory of Mongolia.  With most of Central Asia in his hands, Ungern Khan rules all Mongolic peoples and everyone living in a yurt swears allegiance to him alone. A man beyond the capabilities of other mortals, Ungern is thought of by many Mongolians as an avatar of the God of War or in the very least � as a reincarnation of the great Genghis Khan and with his newest victories those doubting these claims have been reduced to a mere handful. Fuelled by the sweet fruits of victory Ungern Khan has convened a grand assembly in Urga to manifest the triumph of Mongolia�s recent conquests. The question, however, remains whether or not the Mad Baron will satisfy himself with the establishment of a  Greater Mongolia or take his faithful tribal forces and his hardened Savage Division further on the path of ambition, madness and glory ?;;;;;;;;;;x

However, his officers and generals always waited for the right moment to overthrow him, as they considered him an out-of-control warmonger who had no mercy even for his trusted lieutenants. Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern�s demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling. The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government. Commanders loyal to the Khan were arrested without any warning and all major sites in Urga occupied by the putschists. As the rebels stormed the Baron�s residence, Ungern viciously defended himself shooting several leading conspirators in a desperate firefight. However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself.

It was generally believed that he was a reincarnation of Genghis Khan and as such didn�t care much about his original Russian upbringing. But when Ungern was overthrown and his generals took power, the Mongol population was deeply disappointed with the successors� behavior. The former commanders of Ungern's army considered themselves Russians and ruled Mongolia as if were a colony and not their motherland. This oppression combined with the strictness of a military regime caused a wave of riots in the Mongolian army (which consisted of various tribesmen under command of steppe nobility). Leaders of the Mongol tribes under command of noyan (aristocratic title for tribe leaders) Amagaiin Bajudai started a massive anti-government revolt under the slogan of �Mongolian tribes against the Russian oppressors�. Soon a wave of terror covered the steppes...;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_100000_NAME;Status of the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_100000_DESC;Formed in 1924 as a result of the Consolidation Of Resources Act, the Australasian Confederation is the combination of the British Antipode Dominions, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the territories of British New Guinea and Fiji. The years since the Weltkrieg, in which Australian and New Zealand forces served with distinction, have brought great change and hardship. The war strained both society and the economy, which in Australia manifested itself in the short lived Melbourne Commune. Although disowned by the then ruling Labour government and put down by demobilised Australian Imperial Force veterans, this resulted in the implementation of the Emergency Protocols, the suspension of elections and the appointment of William Birdwood as Governor General. Then the British Revolution of 1925 shook the Empire to the core and Australasia was unable to prevent the loss of territories to the Germans. More than 10 years on the situation is still unstable as the economy remains stagnant and domestic dissent continues to grow, with Birdwood alongside his ally Billy Hugh's Nationalist Party, barely holding things together.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_100001_NAME;Australasia And The Oncoming Election;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_100001_DESC;Elections in the Antipodes were suspended by the Emergency Protocols enacted in 1923 which also led to the dissolving of the autonomy of the separate New Zealand Parliament. However, elections are now set for March this year after Stanley Bruce successfully campaigned for their reintroduction. Governor-General Birdwood was forced to make this concession when Bruce defeated Hughes for the leadership of the Nationalist Party and although Bruce's decision not to act as unelected Prime Minister resulted in the expulsion of his faction from the Nationalist Party and Hughes' recall as PM, the public would not accept the government reneging on its commitments. Australasia can ill afford a repeat of 1929 - the spectre of Melbourne remains fresh in the minds of many.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_100003_NAME;A Special Conference of the Australasian Labour Party;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVT_100003_DESC;Today the Australasian Labour Party convened a special session in Sydney where the former premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, was readmitted into the party after having been excluded for 5 years. Lang was originally excluded as a result of his dismissal from government by the contemporary governor of NSW, Philip Game. A powerful orator and a populist through and through, the re-admittance of Lang has caused consternation amongst the more leftist members of the Labour Party who alongside the majority of trade union activists see him more as a social feudalist inherently hostile to true socialist doctrine. It seems that the Australasian Labour Party is heading into a turbulent time, given the imminent election.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_100004_NAME;The Australasian New Guard;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVT_100004_DESC;Originally formed in 1925, the Australasian 'New' Guard is a staunchly nationalist and jingoistic organisation which can trace its roots back to the paramilitary organisations of demobilised servicemen returning from the Great War (the 'Old' Guard) who helped put down the 1923 Melbourne Commune. In the years following the Victoria rising, the New Guard have continued to support the government, with many supporters joining the expanded security forces available to the Governor-General and New Guard members assisting in suppressing left wing activities. The coming return to democratic rule has caused an upset amongst the far right however, fearing the re-emergence of the long suppressed Labour movement and that the Nationalist Party, divided as it is between the Guard and United Australasia will be unable to maintain the status quo. Due to these factors, the New Guard's leader Eric Campbell, has decided that the Guard will take part in the elections as the Centre Party. Despite their not inconsiderable levels of popular support, at present it is unsure what impact they will have though.;;;;;;;;;;x

Eric Campbell's Centre Party, while failing to take many Parliamentary seats, did manage to secure a large percentage of the popular vote, mostly at the expense of the Nationalists.

EVT_100010_DESC;The Australasian Labour Party National Executive met today in Canberra, after being swept into office in an unexpected result. However John Curtin now has to decide which direction to take the party and the nation. There is a schism already opening between the different wings of the party. Jack Lang and the moderate social populist right wing of the party are up against the revolutionary left, consolidating around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. The CTU wants to seize this opportunity to enact real socialist policies throughout Australasia, form a republic in memory of the Melbourne Commune and break from the imperialist Entente. Lang wishes to expel them from the party, maintaining our place in the Empire. Curtin must make a choice, break his party or lead a revolution.;;;;;;;;;;x

Until now, the Guard has been a minor force in Australasian politics, but with their  forceful revanchist rhetoric and populist flair the movement has begun to spread its influence beyond New South Wales, especially gaining support amongst discharged servicemen and disgruntled officers.

This purge of the NSW party has since rippled throughout the Confederation with Lang�s supporters of moderate social populists and anti-Syndicalist union supporters ostracizing and marginalizing their more leftist opponents. This �Great Schism� of the Australasian Labour Party has firmly separated the Antipodean worker�s movement into a reformist and populist rump Labour Party and a revolutionary movement consolidating around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions.

However, with the Entente�s defeat and the ensuring German expansion in the Pacific following the 1925 British Revolution, the federal government has been anxious about strengthening the fighting capabilities of the Australasian army, navy and air force. Today, the results of the National Defence Review have proposed increasing the military�s training strength and funding as a result of the rising tension in Europe and Asia. Some see it as a staging point for the government to launch a campaign arguing for the introduction of conscription and the need for a swift militarization of the Antipodean dominions.;;;;;;;;;;x

However, several leading members of the incumbent administration argue that the time has come for a new attempt at replacing the volunteer ANZAC forces with a conscription-based and better trained armed forces. Such a �conscription campaign� could either strengthen the government if successful or potentially break it - and thus strengthening the extremes of Australasia�s political scene - if failing.

To rectify this a programme of modernisation has been proposed to bring the older vessels up to speed. Expanding our number of capital ships has also been suggested, but as we are currently lacking the advanced shipyards and dry-docks required we would either have to begin a significant infrastructure project to enable Australasia to build these ships ourselves.

Despite fighting together alongside Britain in the Great War and staying true to the Empire after 1925, successive Canadian governments have continued to keep Australasia at arms length due in no small part to a protectionist attitude - not wishing for their own farmers to be out competed by Australasian imports. As such, no bilateral trade agreement exists between the two Dominions. Now however, with Canada's increasing military build-up to prepare for the retaking of the Home Islands and the collapse in trade with the United States due to the instability there, the Canadians may be amenable to allowing us to increase exports to them.

The situation was different however in China where the presence of the other international powers, wary of the Reich dominating foreign trade, helped to maintain the status quo - this lead ultimately to the formation of the Legation Cities. The British concessions have largely integrated into this system - the Governor of Hong Kong, Cecil Clementi, is the current head of the Legations Council and former British colonial units make up a significant part of the Legations defence forces. The primary conduit of international trade in and out of China, the Legation Cities amass considerable profits for their foreign owners, ourselves among them. This makes the Legations a target for every nationalist organisation in China who wish to see their reincorporation and corruption, in the form of the local triads, is endemic.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_100119_DESC;Since our renewed focus on the far flung parts of the former British Empire, a number of Australian and New Zealand firms and corporations have approached our government wishing for us to establish our own trade mission in China. While this could prove profitable, we could also use this opportunity to try and restore relations with the British concessions in China as well. In 1925 we had to rely on the international community to guarantee the continuity of the British legations, now we could send a clear message to Cecil Clementi that Australasia now stands ready to protect their and our interests.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_100190_NAME;A Conference in July;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_100190_DESC;The Australasian Labor Party has convened for its first Federal Conference since Curtin's narrow ascension into the office of Prime Minister today. The main agenda was party unity and how Curtin should deal with the two breakaway wings of the Labor, which split from the Federal branch in 1931.\nThe first, the National Labor Party, is made up of followers of Joseph Lyons, the former Premier of Tasmania who left the Federal Labor caucus in 1930 following disagreements with Ted Theodore and the Federal A.L.P's handling of the economic crisis. After a brief stint in the U.A.P, Lyons would then leave the U.A.P due to its support of Birdwood's heavy-handed approach towards his duties as Governor-General, forming the National Labor Party as a de-jure successor to the party of the same name in 1918. National Labor now stands in an interesting position as a kingmaker with ties to both the U.A.P and Labor Party. Furthermore, the N.L.P has become increasingly appealing to some moderates, many of whom are concerned by Donald Grant and his Industrial-Labor group, deemed by many as a syndicalist cell within the party. Leftists within the party will be greatly dissatisfied by Lyons'  return as he is generally viewed as reactionary within the camp due to his past association with the U.A.P and his support of fiscally conservative economic policies. \nThe second, Lang Labor or more formally known as the New South Wales Labor Party, is made up of supporters of Jack Thomas Lang, the infamous former governor of New South Wales, known for his extremist and militant attitude. Lang's split from the party would come when he denounced the Premiers' Plan to combat the economic downturn in the 20s and put forth his plan for economic recovery, titled the Lang Plan. His defiance of the federal caucus and radicalism would split the party along its radical left and right-wing, with Lyons leading the fiscally conservative right-wing and Lang leading the deflationary left. Lang would however be removed from office by governor Philip Game after his instructions for public servants not to pay money into the Federal Treasury, which was deemed illegal. Though removed from office, Lang would continue to wield much influence within New South Wales and even sought to usurp the position of Federal leader before Curtin's ascension. Reunification with the New South Wales caucus would mean a great boost to our position in parliament, but it carries with it Langite risk that's unpredictable to the extreme. Our moderates will also become angered by Lang's return and may seek to join Lyons' camp as a result.;;;;;;;;;;x

With Lyons's backing,  we've regained a majority in parliament, as his National Labor MPs flock to us.

EVT_123001_DESC;Today the Australasian Labour Party convened a special session in Sydney where the former premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, was readmitted into the party after having been excluded for 5 years. Lang was originally excluded as a result of his dismissal from government by the contemporary governor of NSW, Philip Game. A powerful orator and a populist through and through, the readmittance of Lang has caused consternation amongst the more leftist members of the Labour Party who alongside the majority of trade union activists see him more as a social feudalist inherently hostile to true socialist doctrine. It seems that the Australasian Labour Party is heading into a turbulent time.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_123002_DESC;Both Australia and New Zealand had a troubled relationship with the idea of conscription during the Weltkrieg. In Australia, two consecutive plebsticies about the introduction of conscription were narrowly defeated, leaving the ANZACs and other Antipodean units strictly volunteer-only. However, with the Entente�s defeat and the ensuring German expansion in the Pacific following the 1925 British Revolution, the federal government has been anxious about strengthening the fighting capabilities of the Australasian army, navy and air force. Today, the incumbent government of Billy Hughes has proposed increasing the military�s training strength and funding as a result of the rising tension in Europe and Asia. Some see it as a staging point for the government to launch a campaign arguing for the introduction of conscription and the need for a swift militarization of the Antipodean dominions.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_123003_DESC;The exiled �White Rajah� of Sarawak and noted Sydney socialite, Charles Vyner Brooke has now openly begun to associate with the reactionary grouping known as �the New Guard� led by Weltkrieg veteran Eric Campbell. Until now, the Guard has been a minor force in Australasian politics, but with their  forceful revanchist rhetoric and populist flair the movement has begun to spread its influence beyond New South Wales, especially gaining support amongst discharged servicemen and disgruntled officers. With Brooke�s charm and considerable monetary resources, the New Guard might just have gained the staging point for a showdown with the supposedly complacent and stagnating policies of Hughes and Bruce. The government should be prepared for any eventuality.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_123004_DESC;Conscription has always been a touchy subject in the Antipodean Dominions. Several governments had attempted to enforce it through plebiscites, but were defeated - sometimes narrowly - at the polling stations. However, several leading members of the incumbent administration argue that the time has come for a new attempt at replacing the volunteer ANZAC forces with a conscription-based and better trained armed forces. Such a �conscription campaign� could either strengthen the government if successful or potentially break it - and thus strengthening the extremes of Australasia�s political scene - if failing. Either way, the amount of money the government is prepared to spend on this campaign will be an indicator of failure as well as success.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_123015_DESC;As the votes were being counted it soon became clear that the Yay-side would carry the day. However, complications have arisen since New Zealand overwhelmingly voted no to confederate conscription whilst Australians mainly voted yes. Although a majority for conscription has been achieved, it would be dangerous for our nation�s union to impose it on the New Zealanders. Some members of cabinet have proposed that we let the various administrative regions implement conscription on a local level, thus allowing the Kiwis to maintain their volunteer-based army units.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_123016_DESC;Since Jack Lang�s readmittance in February, the Labour Party has been steaming with internal disputes. Today, Lang struck back at the leftist members of the New South Wales party branch, successfully having them excluded alongside their Syndicalist-friendly trade union comrades from the party. This purge of the NSW party has since rippled throughout the Confederation with Lang�s supporters of moderate social populists and anti-Syndicalist union supporters ostracizing and marginalizing their more leftist opponents. This �Great Schism� of the Australasian Labour Party has firmly separated the Antipodean worker�s movement into a reformist and populist rump Labour Party and a revolutionary movement consolidating around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. Yet all is not well in Labour since friction still exists between Lang and the popular John J. Curtin.;;;;;;;;;;x

Considering that the wars of the future will be fought in the air, this is a grave concern for the ANZAC High Command. However, it is not just aircraft that we are currently falling behind at. Australasia's air defense is at an abysmal state right now, barely able to fight off monoplanes and biplanes, much less new fighters and bombers. Airbase distribution is also a concern, as our airfields are sparse and unevenly spread, leaving the Northern Territory and Queensland exposed to a hypothetical German invasion from Papua.

EVT_100604_DESC;The Hume Dam, considered by many to be Australasia's most ambitious engineering project, has just finished after over 17 years of construction. As of right now, this dam is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, costing the state governments of Victoria and New South Wales nearly 6 million dollars. The dam originated from the need for water conservation after The Federation Drought. In 1903, a royal commission was sent to the River Murray, which then recommended the construction of a dam on the Upper Murray at Cumberoona. The commission also presided over the River Murray Waters Agreement. This agreement formalized the conditions for the dam's construction and water sharing between the three states bordering the river. Construction then began in November 1919. Owing to the scale of the project, a significant amount of land was resumed. This totaled 102,850 acres across Victoria and New South Wales. Many displeased residents and landowners appealed, undertaking legal action to combat construction on their properties, lasting for nearly a decade but did not halt progress. And now that the great work is completed, farming in the Upper Murray basin enters into a new phase. The menace of drought has been removed and whole districts have been placed in a position of safety.;;;;;;;;;;x

At the time of their encounter with the lizard, it had been carrying a cuscus in its mouth. However, this is not the first time we've heard of such "tree crocodiles". These specimens are called "Si-e" by the Koita of Port Moresby and "Aou-angi-angi" by the Eboa of Makeo, both roughly translating to "man-devourer". Local stories about these lizards say that they come at night to eat the bodies of the dead. There have also been various incidences where these creatures were indicated as the culprits. The most notable reports are when a native reported seeing his wife consumed by these creatures, and another where a native tried to rescue his dog from a Si-e, only to be eaten himself. With Mr. Champion's report, their existence seems indisputable, but we are still not sure about the true nature of these creatures.

EVT_100611_DESC;The Territory of Papua is one of the few remaining British colonies after the fall of the Home Islands to the Syndicalists. Since its discovery, Papua has been shown to possess many disadvantages, being sparsely populated and having little potential in the way of agriculture. This is not to mention the constant conflicts between native tribes and the impossible terrain, described by one account as "it was easier to ascend the highest peaks of the European Alps with an alpenstock than to cross an ordinary hill in Papua". Despite all of this, William MacGregor, the first administrator of British New Guinea managed to bring about a state of order after his tenure. The situation had remained calm until the start of the Weltkrieg, where Papua would experience wartime difficulties. Germany's victory and the subsequent collapse of the Empire would grind its administration to a halt when the Consolidation of Resources forced the colonial government to make do with the bare minimum. Now that the situation has somewhat settled for us, it would be wise to take a look to see how Papua is holding up and provide them with more resources or allow for reforms where necessary.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_100612_DESC;The collapse of the British Empire halted any sort of economic development in Papua for over a decade, as Governor Birdwood forced the colony to survive on the bare minimum. However, now that the situation has somewhat stabilized, we must take this opportunity to explore Papua's economic potential. The Papua Bounties Act aims to provide farmers and planters in Papua with bounties from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which would help increase their revenue and encourage them to explore more profitable cash crops still not widely grown in Papua. ;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_100613_NAME;Expand Gold production in the Louisiade Archipelago;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_100613_DESC;In 1889, William MacGregor, the first lieutenant governor of British Papua, discovered gold on Misima Island. Since then, it has become the most prominent gold-producing area of Papua, with output reaching as high as  �56,508 of gold at its peak. However, gold output from these islands declined during the late 20s and still has not recovered to their levels pre-1925. Misima may possess gold and mineral resources still unworked, and we must incentivize mining companies to uncover the island's full potential.  ;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_100614_NAME;Formalizing the Councillor System;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_100614_DESC;The current village councilor system for the various native tribes of Papua was little more than an experiment when it was first established. However, against the expectations and prejudices of many, it seems that the people of Papua do possess the intellectual will to debate policies to make demands. The councilors have been a great help to our administration, and it is thanks to them that we now have a better understanding of tribal grievances. Therefore, institutionalising the council system seems like the thing to do to further improve our administration in Papua. ;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_100615_NAME;Matters of Papuan security;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_100615_DESC;Germany's presence in New Guinea has always been a source of worry for our government. Not only is German New Guinea a security threat, but they also harm the prospects of economic development in Papua by driving away investors. Because of this, several of our generals are petitioning for a budget increase to improve Papua's defenses. However, doing this means that we'll have to divert more resources towards Papua given the scale of the buildups, which government ministers are arguing against. ;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME_100615_A;We shall invest in Papua's defenses.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME_100615_B;There is not much to gain from this;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_100616_NAME;Reinforcement of Papuan defenses complete;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_100616_DESC;We've finished reinforcing Papua's defense network. The territory now boasts an improved road network for military maneuvers. We've also strengthened Port Moresby's defenses with the construction of HMAS base Basilisk as a staging ground for the navy while the RAAF can now use Port Moresby as a base of operation with the recently finished Airfield complex. A detachment of the Royal Australian Artillery Corps has also helped construct various naval forts around the harbor to help fend off against any attempts at an amphibious assault against Port Moresby.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_252000_NAME;Recovering from the Lost Decade;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252000_DESC;In what has come to be called the 'Lost Decade', The 1920's were a time of economic depression and political instability for Japan. The plight was particularly severe in the agricultural sector, and caused a massive demographic change as farmers fled from the depressed countryside to urban areas, flooding the labour market and further driving down wages. After leaving the Kenseikai-led 'Constitutionalist Coalition' and taking charge of the Government, Inukai and his government successfully expanded the Japanese sphere of influence into Manchuria and the edges of Siberia, acquiring a vital export market for the Japanese economy, but the agricultural situation continued to deteriorate as cheap agricultural imports from Manchuria bled into the countryside. As 1936 dawns, continued rearmament and state investment has fully rebuilt the industrial economy, but the issue of rural poverty remains chronic and unsolved.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME_252000_A;OK;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252001_NAME;Dissolution of the Diet;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252001_DESC;The four year term of the incumbent Imperial Diet elected in 1932 is ending. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi has called a general election for February 20th.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252002_NAME;General Election Feb. 1936;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252002_DESC;After the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and subsequent political realignment, two parties came to dominate Japanese politics: the conservative Rikken Seiyukai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) and the liberal Minseito (Democratic Party). The Rikken Seiyukai has an absolute majority from the general election of 1932, but support in the countryside (Their traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base throughout the cities and began to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyukai's absolute majority in the Diet. A new, third player in the general election of 1936 is the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933. It is now time to see if the Seiyukai have retained enough seats to keep an absolute majority...;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252002A;The Seiyukai have defended their absolute majority!;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252002B;The Seiyukai have lost their absolute majority!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252003_NAME;The Assassination of Katayama Sen;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252003_DESC;Born in 1859, Katayama Sen was one of the most senior syndicalist leaders in Japan, known as the 'father of Japanese syndicalism'. Exiled to the USA after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed and was influenced by Jack Reed's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA. Katayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rodo-Nominto (Labour-Farmer Party), and after the party was declared illegal in 1932, he formed another party called the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), an amalgamation of social democratic parties and syndicalist movements. Yesterday, while visiting Kyoto to congratulate Taishuto member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 75, never regained consciousness and died earlier today.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252004_NAME;Friction Within the Japanese Left;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252004_DESC;"The shock of the assassination of Katayama Sen initally united the Shakai Taishuto in solidarity against the ""white terror"", but the unity did not last long. The party was originally structured as a coalition of various social democrat and syndicalist organisations, only united in the goal of 'socialisation of the economic structure with the proletariat at its foundation'. Before his death, Katayama had guided the party away from ideological clashes, but deprived of its leader the party was forced to face the question of its precise ideological position, and infighting soon began. Throughout the spring of 1936, national-syndicalists, called the Nichirokei (Japan-Labour Clique), adopted Totalism and vigorously expanded its membership, not only inside the party at expense of the moderate Shaminkei (Social Democratic Clique) but also outside the party, notably within the Shaminkei-controlled Nihon Rodo Sodomei (Japan General Federation of Labour). Soon an open fight between the two groups broke out. The Nichirokei accused the Sodomei of being run by 'the labour bureaucrat establishment', and in turn the Sodomei and the Shaminkei accused the Nichirokei of hijacking and turning labour organisations into their puppets. The Nichirokei's members were expelled from both the Sodomei and the Taishuto earlier this month, and the group is now operating independently.";;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252005_NAME;Civil Disobedience in Niigata;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252005_DESC;The landlord-tenant relationship in Niigata has always been more 'feudalistic' than any other prefecture, and as the agricultural crisis of the 1930's progressed the prefecture produced some of the worst cases of tenancy dispute. The issue appears to have reached its boiling point. In a Niigata prefecture village named Obaden, a tenancy dispute got out of control and the villagers rioted, attacking officials and landlords. Tenants in the villages of Kisaki and Wata have followed suit, and we have a full-blown uprising on our hands.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252005A;Negotiate with the dissenters;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252005B;Crush this riot;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252006_NAME;Spread of the Niigata Riot;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252006_DESC;We have made little progress negotiating with the Niigata uprising, and to make matters worse it has begun to spread. In the city of Nagaoka, members of a local trade union occupied a section of one of the main factories of the city, demanding higher wages and better working conditions for the labourers. Local police quickly intervened, but killed two of the strikers while taking control of the factory. Sympathetic workers have joined the movement and occupied a good part of the city's industrial districts, and are also calling for a general strike unless their demands are met. They also demand the members of the police unit responsible for the deaths of the two workers be brought to justice.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_252007_DESC;The revolutionary fever is spreading into other depressed areas in the Northeast. Radical member of the Shakai Taishuto are stoking the fire, hoping to launch an all-out syndicalist revolution. The Seiyukai and the general staff are demanding a declaration of martial law to crush the revolution before it starts.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_252010_NAME;The May 15 Incident;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252010_DESC;The Prime Minister has been assassinated! Radical officers connected to the Nichirokei broke into the official residence and shot Prime Minister Inukai. They claim they did it to avenge the death of Katayama Sen and the murder of workers in Niigata. The incident has greatly shocked the nation, and the Admirality Board, mortified by the incident, has already begun a court martial and a deep investigation into radical activities within the Navy.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252010A;Appoint Suzuki Kisaburo to replace Inukai;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252012_NAME;The National Security Act;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252012_DESC;The notorious Peace Preservation Act was introduced in early 1924 by the Tanaka regime amidst the red scare following the Kanto anarchist uprising in September 1923 and a syndicalist's assassination attempt on then-Crown Prince Hirohito in December of the same year. The Act drastically limited civil rights and symbolised the draconian rule of General Tanaka. It was repealed when the regime was brought down by the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but Prime Minister Suzuki Kisaburo now wants to reintroduce the Act, albeit heavily moderated and renamed the 'National Security Act'. He has met strong opposition even within his own cabinet, and public opinion has dropped to a new low, but Suzuki believes its reintroduction is a necessary step to counter the rising tide of syndicalism, and he is not alone in his opinion. A cross-party parliamentary group led by Nakajima Chikuhei of the Rikken Seiyukai and Adachi Kenzo of the Minseito have declared the Act as the 'last bulwark of constitutional government' and support its passage. The House of Peers and the Privy Council are also in favor of the Act.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252012A;The Act is forced through;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252012B;Public opinion and the opposition defeat the Act;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252013_NAME;The Trial of the May 15 Incident;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252013_DESC;The court martial of the eleven murderers of Prime Minister Inukai began on July 24th. Before the end of their trial a petition arrived at court, containing over 350,000 signatures in blood from sympathisers around the country, pleading for a lenient sentence. In addition to the petition, the court also received a request from eleven youths in Niigata, asking that they be executed in place of the Navy officers, and sending eleven severed fingers to the court as a gesture of their sincerity! The whole trial was unpopular enough to convince the court to accelerate the process, and although the death sentences were issued just yesterday, the assassins were executed at dawn today.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252013A;This country is going crazy...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252014_NAME;The Assassination of Suzuki Kisaburo;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252014_DESC;The unthinkable has happened again! Prime Minister Suzuki and his brother-in-law Hatoyama Ichiro were attending a party rally in Kawagoe today. When Hatoyama stood up to deliver his speech, a syndicalist terrorist from the 'Saitama Youth Volunteer Corps for National Salvation', shot Suzuki and Hatoyama in retaliation for the execution of Prime Minister Inukai's assassins. Suzuki's wound has proven fatal.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252014A;Appoint Mizuno Rentaro as Prime Minister;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252015_NAME;Government Under Fire;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252015_DESC;Unsurprisingly, the failure to pass the National Security Act has created a backlash against the Prime Minister. The conservatives and bureaucrats who had backed the bill feel betrayed by Suzuki's back-down. The House of Peers and the Privy Council, disappointed by the Government's incapability to produce any measures against syndicalism, have lost all their patience with the cabinet.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252015A;Suzuki's days are numbered...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252016_NAME;Resignation of Suzuki Kisaburo;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252016_DESC;Abandoned by everyone, the humiliated Prime Minister resigned when the Peers passed a censure motion denouncing the cabinet, and with lukewarm support former Home Minister Mizuno Rentaro was appointed in his place. Ominously, the Privy Council and its ultraconservative chairman Baron Hiranuma released a statement declaring that the 'parliamentary impotency' needs to be replaced by a more stable system.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252016A;Appoint Mizuno Rentaro;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252017_NAME;The Election of Mizuno Rentaro;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252017_DESC;The downfall of Suzuki stunned the Rikken Seiyukai, and an emergency convention was called. The bureaucratic Tokonami faction (named after Tokonami Takejiro (1867-1935), chairman of the pro-Tanaka Seiyu Honto during the Tanaka dictatorship and its aftermath) has been crippled by the loss of their leader, leaving the reactionary Nakajima faction to take control of the party. From his new post as Director of General Affairs, Nakajima enjoys decision-making power over the entire party, but has stopped short of crowning himself chairman and instead elected current Prime Minister and Tokonami-aligned Mizuno Rentaro instead.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252017A;Finally, some stability in politics;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252018_NAME;Japan's Longest Winter;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252018_DESC;The Japanese government has found itself effectively paralyzed. The downfall of two successive Seiyukai Prime Ministers has severely weakened the power of the new Prime Minister, and Hiranuma's open scheme to destroy the parliamentary system has only worsened the political turmoil. Extremist groups are growing by the day, and the military is getting more and more frustrated. Several high-ranking officers within the Army have hatched a plot to overthrow the civilian administration and 'rescue' the Empire. The plotters have approached Army Minister Hayashi Senjuro for his support...;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252018A;He refuses to be a part of it;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252018B;He agrees to support them;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252019_NAME;The January Coup;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252019_DESC;After ten years of political disgrace, the army has taken power again, this time by a coup d'etat. Ultraconservative politician Baron Hiranuma Kiichiro is now Prime Minister, and a state of martial law has been enacted across all of the Greater Japanee Empire.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252019A;Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252020_NAME;Japan's Longest Day;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252020_DESC;Even through the Army Minister refused to support the coup, he made no effort to stop the plot. The plotters interpreted this as a signal of permission, and proceeded. This morning, the coup forces seized the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the new Imperial Diet Building, but failed to occupy the Imperial Palace. To the surprise of the plotters, the Emperor resisted the coup d'etat and issued an imperial command to suppress the rebels, sealing their fate. The coup forces surrendered without resistance and key conspirators were quickly caught, while some took their own lives before they could be arrested. One of them, General Terauchi Hisaichi, committed suicide by seppuku today.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252020A;Democracy has survived;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252021_NAME;Restorationists and Centralists;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252021_DESC;Restorationism was an idea promoted by radical junior officers, characterised by its anti-capitalism, anti-oligarchism and anti-parliamentarism. Usually coming from underprivileged and/or humble backgrounds, many of these officers have experienced poverty from childhood and observed what they considered the evil influence of favouritism, leading them to believe that the establishment has hijacked power from the Emperor and is leading the nation into the abyss. The Restorationist solution was to sweep out the ruling establishment and restore all power back to the Emperor (hence 'restoration', or 'ishin' in Japanese), and from there a complete national reform was to be initiated. Against them were the so-called Centralists, who were close to the central military leadership (thus the name, 'chuo' in Japanese), supported cooperation with the establishment, and the militarisation of politics.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252021A;Will this ever end?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252022_NAME;The Power Struggle;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252022_DESC;Restorationist officers were the main participants of the coup that overthrew the elected government, for they saw the parliamentary system as a plutocratic capitalist institution, however under the successive government the Centralists took the leading role in the new regime and the Restorationists were marginalised from the leadership. The Restorationist leadership has concluded that they were deceived. A new power struggle has begun.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252023_NAME;The March counter-coup;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252023_DESC;Restorationist junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'etat! In the early morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers embarked on missions to seize control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly captured, and the Imperial Palace is under siege. The Navy has mobilized and is sending marines to Tokyo, and only fate will tell if they are able to stop the coup or will choose to crush both army factions and take control of the government...;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252023A;The coup is crushed;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252023B;The navy has crushed the coup AND the Centralists!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252024_NAME;The Centralists Win!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252024_DESC;The Restorationist coup has been defeated. Branded traitors, the Restorationists are being purged all over the country. There are calls for the Army to assume a greater role in government to help root out both the traitors and the syndicalists.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252024A;Army Minister Hayashi will assume the premiership;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252024B;Hiranuma can stay;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252026_NAME;The Government of National Unity;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252026_DESC;Nakajima Chikuhei from the Rikken Seiyukai and Adachi Kenzo from the Minseito, both supports of the National Security Act, have issued a joint statement, urging both the mainstream parties to form a multi-party 'Government of National Unity' to protect the Kokutai (national polity) from the syndicalist threat.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252026A;We need a strong government;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252026B;We don't need your nonsense;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252027_NAME;On the Basic Principles of National Defence;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252027_DESC;After taking power, the Centralists sought a political blueprint for their new regime. They have presented such a blueprint, titled 'On the Basic Principles of National Defence' and have distributed it among the Centralist leadership. Envisioning an 'Advanced National Defence State' (Kodo Kokubo Kokka), the document proposes to transform the state into one geared and ready for total war. To this end, not only must Japan's economic structure be reorganised along a militarist line, but the Japanese people must be 'ideologically enlightened' to abandon self-interest. They must abandon class struggle, which is harmful to national security, and restructure society along a moral economic line.;;;;;;;;;;x
ACTIONNAME252027A;This is the way we should go forward;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252028_NAME;The Fund Adjustment Ordinance;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252028_DESC;The Fund Adjustment Ordinance is the first of a series of 'National Defence Ordinances' decreed by the Centralist regime. The state-owned Bank of Japan is now empowered to regulate capital investments, establishment of companies, and the subscription or underwriting of securities. This will allow the Government to control and allocate funds into war industries.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252029_NAME;On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252029_DESC;'On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure' is a 156 page pamphlet produced by the Ministry of Education to establish an official description of the 'Kokutai', or national structure (It can also can be translated as 'national essence', 'national polity', etc). The pamphlet officially enshrines the Emperor as a living god, according to the legend of the Goddess Amaterasu and 'an unbroken line of emperors' (Banseiikkei). To serve the divine Emperor, his subjects were required to cast themselves aside for the social harmony (Wa) and for the prosperity of Japanese culture. To some extent, the pamphlet is a response to criticism of the Centralist's 'Neo-Shogunism'.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252030_NAME;The National Total Mobilisation Ordinance;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252030_DESC;The National Total Mobilisation Ordinance is designed to provide the Government a means to control and mobilise all the resources and manpower available. During war-time, we will have full control over the labour supply, production of goods, financial interaction, industrial and labour organisations, prices, and the press.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252031_NAME;Reintroduction of Compulsory Military Training Curriculum;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252031_DESC;Military training was firstly introduced into the compulsory physical education curriculum in 1925 by the Tanaka regime, as a way to subdue growing anti-militarist influence and discontent among students, and was discontinued with the Constitutional Restoration of 1926. It is time to reverse that decision.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252032_NAME;The National Service Draft Ordinance;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252032_DESC;The National Service Draft Ordinance is a supplement to the earlier National Total Mobilisation Ordinance, particularly its Article 4, which had enabled the Government to mobilise the labour force. The new Ordinance authorises the Government to conscript workers for war industries.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252033_NAME;The New System Movement;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252033_DESC;To mobilise support for the regime and its reform programme, the 'New System Movement' (Shintaisei Undo) has been organised. Led by Prince Konoe Fumimaro, the movement aims for the creation of a political institution that is capable of merging and binding people into the organic whole of the nation - basically a Japanese breed of corporatism, with the Emperor at its head. The movement's immediate goal is the combination of all political perspectives into one party- the Imperial Rule Assistance Society (Taisei Yokusankai).;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252034_NAME;The First Convention of the Taisei Yokusankai;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252034_DESC;The Taisei Yokusankai, or Imperial Rule Assistance Society, is structured as a new political core institution that will represent every aspect of society, unlike the old 'plutocratic' Imperial Diet. It will branch out into every administrative level from hamlet to prefecture, and create a core group consisting of talented individuals from academic, cultural, economic, governmental, military, political, and all other professional occupations. In theory, by penetrating to the grass-roots level a direct link between politics and the people will be established, and by having every important interest group represented at its core it would be possible to coordinate and develop effective national policy. Sadly, that vision has already collapsed, as the various movements the Taisei Yokusankai was meant to bind together have already begun to argue and compete for control of the society...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252035_NAME;Clarifying the Role of the Taisei Yokusankai;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252035_DESC;Three main groups have emerged at the convention. The leading group is the Kakushinha (Reformist Faction) headed by none other than Prince Konoe himself, composed of reform-minded intellectuals and politicians. The second group is the Kodoha (Imperial Way Faction), named after General Araki's frequent usage of the word 'Imperial Way', or 'Kodo', composed of reserve or active Restorationist military leaders. Third is the Yokuseiha, mainly composed of former parliamentary politicians who sympathised with the Restorationist cause. The name 'Yokuseiha' originated from an abbreviation of a political association of Restorationist sympathisers, the Yokusan Seijikai (Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association). The latter two object to the Kakushina's forceful agenda, and even question the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai. Konoe had designed the Taisei Yokusankai as a central nervous system of the upcoming 'New System', combining all legislative, executive and administrative powers into one. Konoe assured that the old Meiji Constitution would remain as it is and the Taisei Yokusankai would not replace the Imperial Diet, but the very idea of the political leviathan has met with vigorous opposition.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_252036_NAME;Reorganising the National Economy;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252036_DESC;For a long time economic reorganisation has been on the agenda of Restorationists, but no consensus has ever existed on how the reorganisation is to be accomplished. The Kakushinha did not hide its anti-business sentiment when they proposed abolishing the Zaibatsu system entirely and replacing it with a bureaucratic central planning system. The Kodoha share the same sentiment, but instead want direct nationalisation, especially of the arms and other industries vital to national security, while the Yokuseiha favour a minimalist approach and are vehemently against handing control of the economy to the state bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;x

ACTIONNAME252036C;Minimise the state's role;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252037_NAME;Dealing with the Agrarian Crisis;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252037_DESC;The Restorationists have always been particularly interested in rural poverty. Many Restorationist officers themselves come from an impoverished rural background, and the collapse of traditional agrarian society is widely considered as the main cause of the rise of syndicalism. The Kakushinha again want to establish bureaucratic control on the tenancy system, but the Kodoha seek to abolish landlordism completely and force land reform. The Yokuseiha propose colonial emigration as a way to diffuse the problem.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_252043_NAME;Nagata versus Obata;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252043_DESC;The ongoing factional rivalry within the ranks of the IJA has found a new front: the military strategic debate between the two rising stars, Major General Nagata Tetsuzan (Centralist) and Major General Obata Toshishiro (Restorationist). General Obata believes the Japanese economy is inadequate to sustain any kind of total warfare, and due to volatile international tensions, war would come to Japan before the country could ever achieve such a capability through internal development. Accordingly, he came to the conclusion that in future wars, the IJA must seek the quick destruction of hostile forces by waging war through short, rapid, and decisive operations, to avoid a long war. Since any long-term war strategy is futile to him, Obata places high priorities on operational planning and field initiative. General Nagata's analysis is nearly identical, but he has come to a different conclusion, and argues that building up a total war capable army should be the top objective. He calls for expanding our mobilisation capability, modernising equipment, and centralising the command structure.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_252046_DESC;The events of 1937 left a deep scar on the Imperial Japanese Army. Dozens of military thinkers and high-ranking officers were involved in the failed January coup and subsequently purged, showing how deeply radicalism had infiltrated into the Army. In an attempt to empower political moderates and neutrals within the IJA, a structural reorganisation has been called and discussed, but to avoid increasing internal tensions any further, the reorganisation has been constantly delayed.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_252051_DESC;During the Rikken Seiyukai convention of 1936, Nakajima had felt his leading role was insecure and made power-sharing agreements with other factions. One such agreement was that the powerful post of the Secretary-General would remain vacant (but not abolished), with its tasks transferred to the collective leadership of the General Council. Last month, believing he had solidified his position, Nakajima attempted complete his domination by capturing the office of Secretary-General. To this end, he formally advised the General Council to return the post to former Secretary-General Kuhara Fusanosuke, who sympathised with the Reformists, and on April 28th Nakajima and his clique formed the 'Kakushin Domei' (Reformist Alliance), effectively a party within a party, pressing the General Council even further. After the general election had concluded, on May 14th the pro-Nakajima chairman of the General Council Horikiri Zenbe forced the issue to a vote within the Council, but the motion was vetoed by all other factions. Isolated within the upper echelons, the Reformists tried to overcome the situation by calling a convention to mobilise their local party cadres, but this was turned down by all other non-Reformist leaders again, frustrating Nakajima even more. Today, just a month after the election, the Kakushin Domei formally declared its independence from the Rikken Seiyukai.;;;;;;;;;;x

One view, shared by many 'Reform Bureaucrats' (Kakushin Kanryo), sees the traditional landlord-tenant relationship as an obstacle to modern agricultural production and proposes nationalizing the agricultural sector, while the other takes a more Malthusian approach, and promotes a mass emigration of farmers to settle our continental holdings.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_252074_NAME;The Agricultural Land Control Act;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252074_DESC;Last year Japan suffered a tremendous drought, and our food supply chain was nearly crippled. To prevent another disaster like this, the government has created the Agricultural Land Control Act. The Act stipulates that conversion or trade of farmland for non-agricultural purposes must be approved by local authorities, and allows them to select the crops to be planted in order to secure maximum production of staple foods.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252075_NAME;The Land Reform Act;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_252075_DESC;The Land Reform Act is designed to limit landlordism and provide farmland for poor farmers. It will enforce redistribution of all land owned by absentee landlords and land exceeding five hectares owned by resident landlords within the next four years.

EVT_252084_DESC;The Tokko, or 'Special Higher Police', is a police force specialising in social and thought crimes. The Tokko is also notorious for its abusive and brutal methods of interrogation, sometimes even resulting in death. When the National Security Act was passed, the Tokko rapidly expanded its size and operation, and their regard for the safety of accused criminals declined even further. Today a major newspaper has reported that a man died while in custody, and has accused the Tokko of torturing the victim to death.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_252086_DESC;The country is in the middle of the worst drought it has seen in this century. Water supplies are critically low and crops are dying of thirst. In some regions, local officials are organising rainmaking rituals in a desperate attempt to evoke storms and calm the people, but to no avail. Fortunately, the drought is mostly affecting southern Korea, western Honshu and the southern islands, and although rice harvests have dropped significantly no state of famine has developed. However the disruption to food production from the drought is severe enough to force us to close down several rice exchanges, including the famous Dojima Rice Exchange, and control the rice supply directly, at least for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_270000_DESC;Since her formation, Bolivia has not fared well in terms of her foreign policy, suffering many painful losses. A border conflict with Chile led to the 'Saltpetre War' (1879 � 1883), where Bolivia lost despite an alliance with Peru, and ended with the nation being forced to cede the coastal province of Antofagasta, losing its access to the sea. Later, In 1903, Brazil and Bolivia signed the Treaty of Petr�plis, ceding the important rubber producing province Acre to Brazil in a shameful agreement that still angers Bolivians to this day. While Bolivia's mining wealth increased over the years, so did the influence of mining companies in the government, and their capacity to influence policy. Then the Chaco War happened, where despite fleeting glory in a few victories that prolonged the war, Bolivia was defeated thoroughly, and Paraguay only sued for peace at Brazil's and Peru's request, both fearing a full collapse of the Bolivian state. The apocalyptic defeat at the hands of Paraguay was more than a crushing blow to Bolivian national pride, it was also a severe blow for Bolivian democracy and economy as most of the population now believes that the Chaco War was the doing of said mining corporations meddling in public affairs Considering Bolivia's status as instigator of the war in the disputed territory, the punishment was severe: the Chaco to the east of the Parapeti river, north of the Pilcomayo and east of the Andes was to be ceded to Paraguay in its entirety and in perpetuity; its oil wealth forever in foreign hands.The corrupt civilian government was quickly blamed for the humiliation, as many generals and officers publicly decrying interference from the president Daniel Salamanca and his liberal allies. Germ�n Busch and David Toro, two decorated war heroes, couped the government in early 1934 and established a ''Government of National Salvation'' with a broad base of support, but no defined ideology other than seeing the needs of the army met, adjusting the fiscal mess left by the war and attempting to improve the situation of the poor in the cities. Even though Germ�n made extensive changes to the constitution, the situation remains as desperate as ever and it will not take much for the Bolivian economy to collapse should Tin prices plummet even further. Despite all this, Bolivians still look outwards, remembering the old glory days and await anxiously for the day that justice is made and Chaco and a coastline are returned to them!;Since her formation, Bolivia has not fared well in terms of her foreign policy, suffering many painful losses.

EVT_755002_DESC;Brazil's fragile First Republic has been on the brink of its end since her humiliating defeat by Argentina on last year's war. The apparent stability represented by the 'Caf� com Leite' doctrine - the dominance of Brazilian politics by the landed oligarchies of S�o Paulo and Minas Gerais - is revealing itself a farse, as general dissent against the federal government becomes more and more apparent. Old rivalries between different sectors of society are awaken. Unsatisfaction by the local elites of the South and Northeast against the government in Rio, and also by the industrialists in S�o Paulo, is growing. The 'canga�o' bandits, led by figures like Lampi�o and Corisco, are running rampant and harassing farmers in Cear�, Bahia and Pernambuco. The Brazilian Workers Confederation, an umbrella organization for the syndicalist movement, is sponsoring heavy labor strikes in the South-Southeast. Meanwhile, populist and nationalist thoughts are growing amongst the army and the middle class. Not even the armed forces can be trusted anymore: the 'Tenentes', the nonpartisan junior officers who organized the mutinies amongst the Army during the final stages of the war, can - and will - be mobilized by any side of the political spectrum. Emergency elections have been called for August, and some say that only a miracle can save democracy in Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755003_DESC;This morning, the small city of Cruzeiro, S�o Paulo, was visited by the remaining leaders of the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB, Partido Comunista Brasileiro) as they organized their clandestine IV Party Congress. Founded in 1922 and much present on the very early days of the labour movement, the PCB is now a shadow of its former self, as a great part of its leaders and members have moved to other movements and parties, such as the Workers and Peasants Bloc (BOC, Bloco Oper�rio e Campon�s), the Brazilian Workers' Confederation (CBT, Confedera��o Brasileira dos Trabalhadores) and the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR, Partido Socialista Revolucion�rio). The strict adherence to the old Soviet Bolshevist doctrine by the party inner circle is seen by most as the main reason for its failure. With this in mind, the rump party voted by a great majority to dissolve itself and be absorved by the CBT. A small part of the old guard, however, led by Oct�vio Brand�o, is keeping an eye on the developments of the Totalist ideas in Britain, and have already announced that the Party may be refounded on the near future.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_7550050_DESC;Due to the unstable political situation in our country, specially after our defeat on the Platine War, emergency elections have been called for the 1st of August. Four main coalitions are disputing: first, we have the Alian�a Nacional Libertadora (ANL, National Liberation Alliance), a broad front for the left-wing parties, composed of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the political sides of the BOC and CBT syndicates. Next, we have the Liberal-Democrats (Liberal-Democratas), an ad-hoc coalition of center-left and liberal forces under former president J�lio Prestes, politically-experienced and presenting themselves as a moderate alternative to the present situation. Further to the right we have the Republicans (Republicanos), an union of conservative parties, joining landowners and industrial capitalists with the right-wing forces of the military under the leadership of populist Get�lio Vargas. The fourth main coalition are the authoritarian Brazilian Integralist Action (AIB, A��o Integralista Brasileira), the nationalist and populist party under Pl�nio Salgado. After a very passionate campaign, the elections took place today. As the votes were counted, the next President of Brazil was announced...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755006_DESC;Despite all of the setbacks we have suffered on the previous years, the Alian�a Nacional Libertadora grand coalition has managed to elect Edgard Frederico Leuenroth, of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, as the next president of Brazil. The fifty-five year old journalist and long-time anarchist was one of the organizers of the general strikes in S�o Paulo in 1917-1919, helping establish the anarcho-syndicalist movement in the country. He was seen, thus, by the ANL leadership, as their obvious candidate for the presidency. And today is his inauguration day! Despite what some purists think, we may be forced to work on a coalition with some left-wing elements of Liberal-Democrats to appease some parts of the middle classes. A much more palatable solution for us would be asking the left-wing Tenentes into our coalition. Others, however, still think we can handle the whole government all by ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755007_DESC;At least until we enact a new constitution, the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, although real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with both houses of the Congress and with the remaining Ministers. All the three main parties of the ANL have put forward their own candidates for the post. L�vio Xavier of the BOC, Astrogildo Pereira of the CBT, and Jo�o da Costa Pimenta of the PSR. So, who shall we choose?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755008_DESC;We were assured that the Brazilian people still believes on democracy. J�lio Prestes, president from 1930 to 1934, will return to office. Despite all the mess which has been brought to the country by the incompetence of the present government and by extremists from the right and left, the very institutions upon which the Federative Republic has been laid down were not shaken. And we know democracy is all about negotiating and laying alliances, right? Some parts of our bloc believe in asking the center-left elements of the military into our coalition, which will appease the armed forces. Others, however, think that inviting Get�lio Vargas and his Republicans would calm down the landowners and other conservative forces. So, what shall we choose?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755009_DESC;Although the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with both houses of the Congress and with the remaining Ministers. Our bloc has put forward three different candidates for the post. Washington Lu�s, president from 1926 to 1930, supported J�lio Prestes both on his 1930 campaign and on this year, so he would be a most likely choice. Two other candidates must also be considered, however: former Piau� governor Ol�mpio de Melo and Borges de Medeiros, the traditional ga�cho politician. Choosing a chief of staff from a smaller state, instead of the paulista Washington Lu�s, would grant us a greater support base among the traditionalist classes, altough we will miss the former president's political expertise.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755010_DESC;Tradition has scored a victory. The people of Brazil has chosen Get�lio Vargas of the Republican bloc as the new president. Coming from a traditional rancher family of the southern Pampas, Vargas was seen by his coalition as a compromise candidate, appeasing the landowners from the South, Southeast and Northeast, the industrial bourgeoisie and, thanks to him states rights platform, the whole range of conservative forces. Plus, his populist speeches also seduced a portion of the proletariat, thanks to his promises of new labour laws and a more efficient social security system. Now, for a even more effective governing of Brazil, we must consider some political alliances with the other voting blocs. Should Vargas attempt a deal with the right-wing Tenentes led by Eurico Gaspar Dutra, his old friend from his time on the army? Some, however, are dreaming about a coalition with the nationalist A��o Integralista Brasileira. Despite the obvious differences between the pro-states rights Republicanos and the autoritharian AIB, some of their policies are perfectly compatible with ours. Plus, this would mean a greater support from the middle classes.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755011_DESC;In Brazil, at least until we enact a new constitution, the President acts as Head of State, although real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with the ministers and with both houses of the Congress. Our bloc has put forward three different candidates for the post. Former governor of S�o Paulo, Altino Arantes, would surelly appease the industrialist classes and the coffee breeders of the state. Another good choice would be Eurico Gaspar Dutra, Vargas old friend from the army and one of the few succesfull leaders of the war against Argentina. Finally, if we want to please the oligarchs from the Northeast, Para�ba governor Jo�o Pessoa would be the ideal candidate.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755012_DESC;The people of Brazil has chosen a change - Pl�nio Salgado is the new president! No more politics will be dominated by the interests of a small ruling class! We are also fed up of harassing by the syndicalist bandits! This decadent and unpopular government will be rebuilt from scratch according to our ideology. However, it would be wise to form a coalition government with like-minded politicians... Inviting the more far-right elements of the armed forces would be a nice move, according to some. Others, however, believe in striking a deal with Get�lio Vargas' Republicans - their populist ideas actually match several points of our own agenda!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755013_DESC;At least until we enact a new constitution, the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, although real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with the ministers and with both houses of the Congress. The AIB has put forward two different candidates for the post. The party's favourite is Gustavo Barroso, the political theorist responsible for much of the Integralist doctrine. Another option would be Euclides Figueiredo, the former army colonel.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755014_DESC;Brazil was hit hard by the Berlin Stock Market Crash, as the country has a heavy dependence on foreign markets and loans. Despite the industrial development in S�o Paulo, the export of coffee and other primary products is still the mainstay of the economy. Days after the Berlin stock market crash, coffee quotations immediately fell 30 percent. Now, while we still are the government of Brazil, we must take a decision. Sticking to the principles preached by the foreign bankers may preserve our economy from some of the worse effects of the crisis, but will anger the people even more. However, suspending the convertibility of the Real and the Papiermark would be disastrous for our economy and foreign trade.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755017_DESC;We will now face our first challenge: how to deal with the current economical crisis? Our cabinet believes that the first steps must be taken on the fields. Since the beggining of the Berlin panic, world demand for our agricultural products has fallen dramatically, and the grand landowners (mainly the sugar and coffee barons) are struck with unsellable harvests. Soon more and more poor peasants will either starve or look for better opportunities in the cities, while the landowners will take the opportunity to blame the federal government for not helping them out of the mess. We could use this opportunity to initiate a broad land reform programme, but the landowners (especially the northeastern coron�is) would of course raise their voices.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755019_DESC;Two years ago, as the war against Argentina was still ongoing and the first mutinies were ecloding, Lu�s Carlos Prestes led a batallion of some two hundred like-minded officers and corporals away from the frontlines. Influenced by syndicalist ideals, the group spent the following years travelling across Brazil on horseback, speaking to the crowds about the futility of the war and spreading the word of social justice, while also fleeing from chasing police, army regulars and, specially in the northeastern states, from paramilitary units of jagun�os, the coron�is' thugs. The 'Prestes Column', as the group came to be known, camped from January to September 1935 on the hinterlands of Bahia, Pernambuco, Para�ba, Cear� and Piau�, seeing with their own eyes the harsh and miserable life of the poor sertanejo peasants, a chapter of our recent history that is seen as the birth of the left-tenentista movement. Now, as the syndicalist government of Brazil has announced their plans for an extensive land reform programme, Prestes has offered his services to us and will lead a new two-months-long survey mission to Bahia and Cear�, thus helping the comission to better implement their new policies and adapt them to the regional necessities.;;;;;;;;;;x

Now, as the syndicalist government of Brazil has announced their plans for an extensive land reform programme, Prestes, currently our Chief Minsiter, has offered his intention of leading a new two-months-long survey mission to Bahia and Cear�, thus helping the comission to better implement their new policies and adapt them to the regional necessities. However, Prestes needs our approval before departing on this new adventure.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755021_DESC;Today, the 'Prestes Column' approached the city of Juazeiro, Cear�, where they were greeted on the outskirts of the city by a band of a few dozen cangaceiros under the command of Lampi�o, so-called the 'King of Canga�o'. On their constant fighting against the landowners' thugs, sometimes for their own personal glory, sometimes for a sincere protection of the poorer peasants, labeled either as heroes or bandits, the cangaceiros are an integral part of the complex social-political landscape of the northeastern states. One of the column's members, a devoted Marxist of the PSR, lectured both the Coluna and the cangaceiros on how the movement can be seen as an spontaneous revolutionary movement of the poor men and women against the feudal opression of the coron�is. Thus, he continues, if we could introduce the canga�o bands to the ANL programmes, they could serve us very well on political brawls against the conservative landowners of these states.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755022_DESC;After a two-months long journey across Bahia and Cear�, the second 'Prestes Column' made a triumphal return to our capital today. Lu�s Carlos Prestes himself made a long speech in downtown Rio de Janeiro sharing the adventures of his companions with the passer-bys. He stressed that, while the life of the northeastern peasant is still much harsh, they have much expectation now that the ANL has assumed power. Prestes then proceeded to the Pal�cio do Catete, where he presented his finds and suggestions to the land reform comission.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_755024_DESC;After dozens of surveys during the past months, a comission made up of members of the BOC, CBT and PSR, led by Minervino de Oliveira, has produced a white paper detailing three main plans for agrarian reform in Brazil. 'Plan A', defended by the BOC, proposes the collectivization of all arable land and their reorganization into smallers plots, headed by the peasants themselves, who will then organize and combine into cooperatives to sell their produce. The CBT-supported 'Plan B' sees the confiscation of all land by the federal government and its reorganization into grand state farms employing the majority of the rural population. There's still one more possibility, the 'Plan C' defended by the PSR. This third, more moderate option, proposes the collectivization of all the bigger farms and lands, while leaving the medium-sized and smaller lands still as private property. Plan C also defends the confiscation of unused plots and their reorganization into cooperatives - a system similar to the Ejidos adopted by Mexico after their revolution. Any of these options will make the big landowners complain, of course, but we must stick to our plans if we want the betterment of Brazil!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755025_DESC;A group of coron�is - the traditional landed oligarchs of the northeastern states - has met today in Fortaleza, Cear�, and delivered a letter to the state governor to be handed to the President. On this document, they express their concern over 'the takeover of Brazil by socialist bandits' and promise to fight for the integrity of their lands. They also spoke on the 'supposed' support of the local peasants to the land reform. In fact, they say, most of the poorer farmers actually feel protected under the patronage of the coron�is!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755027_DESC;The landed oligarchs of S�o Paulo have presented us with an issue. With coffee prices falling day by day on the international markets, these farmers are filling their warehouses with more and more unsellable harvests. According to our economists, if we don't act now, the deepening agricultural crisis will end up affecting not only the grand farmers, but also the poorer peasants that have just been benefited through our programmes.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755029_DESC;News of the compromise between the elites and the government against the peasants of Brazil, who were expecting a broad land reform programme, has already reached the streets. Discontent is much apparent. Over the last few days, a sector of Tenentista officers of our army, under the leadership of Lu�s Carlos Prestes and Isidoro Dias Lopes, has been setting up a plan to overthrow Edgard Leuenroth and, with this, 'save the socialist project for Brazil from being aborted by an weak, uncommited and incompetent president'. News of this growing conspiracy have already reached some parts of our cabinet. Now, how should our government act? We can't simply dismiss Prestes from the army, as that would bring the whole armed forces against the government. We could, instead, remove him from his present post and relocate him to some remote station... That would be enough of a punishment for him and would save everyone from any major scandal. Or we could embrace his conspiracy and put him on the presidency.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755030_DESC;Army units all over the country have been mobilized over the past few hours as news of the launching of a military coup under captain Lu�s Carlos Prestes and general Isidoro Dias Lopes have reached the barracks. The uprising started in S�o Paulo, as troops occupied police stations and the main public buildings, a move that soon followed on all the capitals and major cities. In Rio de Janeiro, president Edgard Leuenroth fled to the mountain areas of the state with his cabinet, while Prestes and Isidoro entered the Pal�cio do Catete. Prestes and Isidoro then delivered a long speech before the Senate announcing the formation of a new provisional military government, which 'will keep Brazil on its course to progress and socialism, without fearing the ramblings of the reactionary elites'.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755031_DESC;The coron�is and other conservative forces in the northeastern states are increasingly uncooperative against our reform programmes and are becoming more vocal opponents of the federal government in Rio de Janeiro. This morning, representatives of the Land Reform Comission approached one of the farms of famous coronel Chico Her�clio, in Limoeiro, eastern Pernambuco. As these federal represantatives informed the coronel of the government's decision to confiscate those lands, they were attacked by a band of his armed thugs! Of the ten men and women of the group, six managed to flee on horseback, while one was shot and killed by the jagun�os and the remaining three are held in captivity. Some members of our cabinet believe that a heavy response to the situation in Limoeiro is just what we need to keep the coron�is in line. With the For�a P�blica (the Pernambuco State Police) still under their control, we may need to form a detachment of a few dozen men from our regular army and send them to Chico Her�clio's lands. Alternatively, given that a small band of Lampi�o's cangaceiros are approaching that city, this also could be a chance to test their loyalty to us. Some ministers, however, think that any harsh action will only trigger more unrest from these still strong conservative forces.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755032_DESC;The coron�is and other conservative forces in the northeastern states are increasingly uncooperative against our reform programmes and are becoming more vocal opponents of the federal government in Rio de Janeiro. This morning, representatives of the Land Reform Comission approached one of the farms of famous coronel Chico Her�clio, in Limoeiro, eastern Pernambuco. As these federal represantatives informed the coronel of the government's decision to confiscate those lands, they were attacked by a band of his armed thugs!

EVT_755033_DESC;The 40-strong army detachment led by captain Juarez T�vora sent to deal with the hostage crisis in Limoeiro, Pernambuco, has suceeded in their mission! Having arrived on Recife the previous night, the men moved northwest to Chico Her�clio's ranch. After a quick gunfight which left five of his jagun�os dead, the remaining thugs surrendered. The hostages - two men and one woman - were freed and finally proceeded to deliver their eviction note to Her�clio, who was then arrested. This farm, formerly a land of exploitation, will be plowed by his own former employees. Now that we have shown the coron�is our force and will to defend our ideals, the land reforms will go on untroubled. However, we must decide now on how to deal with the conservative state governments. Should we replace these governors with our own appointed Federal Interventors? Or maybe it would be wiser to hold a grand conference with them?;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755034_DESC;The 40-strong army detachment led by captain Juarez T�vora sent to deal with the hostage crisis in Limoeiro, Pernambuco, has failed in their mission! Having arrived on Recife the previous night, the mission probably fell victim of an informant. As the men moved northwest to Chico Her�clio's ranch, a band of thirty jagun�os shot on our surprised troops! Ten of our men died on the scene, and a fierce gunfight ensued, in which twelve of the thugs fell. An advanced party ran to the farmhouse only to find the three hostages - two men and one woman - dead and Chico Her�clio fleeing to the hinterlands. We have been humiliated! Not only that, but now he have to deal with the conservative state governors who take us responsible for the bloodbath!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755035_DESC;While Lampi�o and his band were approaching the city of Limoeiro, they were attacked by a small patrol of the For�a P�blica. The ill-prepared policemen, however, were no match for the cangaceiros, who proceeded to take control of the local police station and remaining public buildings. Meanwhile, the main force of thirty men under Lampi�o himself advanced towards Chico Her�clio's ranch, and a quick gunfight with the jagun�os followed. Two of the cangaceiros fell on the scene, but they managed to kill or capture all thirty of Her�clio's thugs. Another five of Lampi�o's men raided the main farmhouse, where they found the three hostages - two men and one woman. As they were approaching one of the rooms to apprehend Chico Her�clio, the farmer shot the cangaceiros with his own revolver and hit two before being killed. Despite the bloodshed, the cangaceiros' raid was a success. This farm, formerly a land of exploitation, will be plowed by Her�clio's own former employees. Plus, we are now sure of the loyalty of Lampi�o and his men to our agenda. Now that we have shown the coron�is our force and will to defend our ideals, our land reforms will go on untroubled. However, we must decide now on how to deal with the conservative state governments. Should we replace these governors with our own appointed Federal Interventors?

EVT_755036_DESC;Representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture met today in Recife with a delegation of state governors led by Pernambuco's Carlos de Lima Cavalcanti. The central government demands a greater cooperation of the conservative forces to our socialist reforms - something that the reactionaries find an insult. The governors, on the other hand, want less pressure from Rio and the option to a less severe application of the land reforms. With this conservative initiative receiving more and more support from the northeastern elites, any concession may be seen as a threat to our progressive policies and will be regarded by other sectors of society as a sign of weakness by our government.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755037_DESC;The conference between the Federal and State governments held for the past days in Recife has yield results. The representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture have agreeded on a more relaxed version of the Land Reform Programmes for the northeastern states, something that will allow the coron�is to retain a lot of their political power. In return, the conservative forces who rule these states will remain silent on our future measures, such as the industrial reforms and social programmes.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755038_DESC;It's been almost an year since the beginning of the Berlin Crisis but, despite our best efforts, the effects of the horrible decisions of the previous government are still being felt by the Brazilian public. Unemployment is still rising, companies are going bankrupt every day and capital is fleeing our country. This is the right time to introduce socialist measures to the economy - just like we have done to agriculture. The people are awaiting our decision.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755039_DESC;Some local and foreign investors have been looking towards our public companies. Most Brazilian industries are owned by the private initiative, but the federal and state governments do control some key areas, such as the national banks, the harbours, and some electricity and water distribution companies. Some economists say that these enterprises are somewhat of a money drain to the state, big and unnefective companies diverting capital that would see better use in other areas. So, why don't we share these troubles with the private initiative? We could promote the establishment of public-private partnerships and make some of our companies into mixed-capital ventures. That way, we could use the expertise of the industrial capitalists but work them on a socialist framework. Orthodox Marxist economists, however, defend that we should keep these companies entirelly with us, since they were established with taxpayers money and thus belong to the people and the state of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755040_DESC;With a great deal of private companies going bankrupt, unemployment is rising in Brazil. We should be assuming control of these enterprises before their bad handling harm our economy even more! An alternative would be promoting the establishment of public-private partnerships and making some of these companies into mixed-capital ventures. That way, we could use the expertise of the industrial capitalists but work them on a socialist framework.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755041_DESC;Some members of our coalition are debating who is the best man to head the Ministry of Industry and Armaments during these present economical reforms. The PSR has put forward their own Manuel Cend�n, who defends that these new revenues must be invested into military supplies. Elias Iltchenco, of the BOC, suggests that this coming capital has to be transformed into more industrial capacity and the researching of new manufacturing methods. The CBT's Hermog�nio da Silva Fernandes, however, defends that we should increase our investiments into military research.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755042_DESC;It's already been some time since we have started implementing our new economic policies, but they have yet yield little result. Unemployment rates still haven't dropped, while the increase in industrial output has been minimal. We are even starting to lose support amongst our own powerbase! The CBT syndicate has organized a four-hour-long strike in Rio de Janeiro demanding a review of these policies. Minervino de Oliveira, a leading figure of the CBT, proposes the transformation of more companies into cooperatives. According to him, if we give up some control of our companies and divert these responsabilities to the factory managers and to the workers themselves, they will come up with smartest decisions - better than handling every single local problem to a bureaucrat far away in Rio! Some parts of our cabinet, including our Minister of Industry, believe instead in increasing state control over these companies.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755043_DESC;A group of southeastern industrialists led by Cicillo Matarazzo has organized a token resistance against our industrial reforms. Much like the norhteastern coron�is in the past attempted to block the entrance of our federal employees to their farms, representatives of the Ministry of Industry are being prohibited from entering factories in S�o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro by private security personel. Matarazzo is attempting to force us to the table for terms more favorable for him and his friends.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755044_DESC;Our government has decided on holding a conference with Cicillo Matarazzo and other industrialist businessmen. It is hoped that we will be able to finally reach an agreement and continue our industrial reforms unimpeded. Matarazzo hopes to convince us to slow down the pace of these reforms, however - this will be seen as a sign of weakness of our part, and may lead to these industrialists making more unacceptable demands in the future.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755045_DESC;Our loyal proletarians have reported an outrageous finding! A number of foreign-owned factories in S�o Paulo have been dismantled over the past nights. Heavy industrial equipment owned mainly by the conglomerates of Cicillo Matarazzo and Percival Farquhar is currently being dispatched by truck and train towards the port of Santos and from there will follow by ship to Matarazzo's homeland, the present-day Italian Federation. Our security services are positioned on the harbor and expect an order from the federal government. Seizing this material and returning it to S�o Paulo is the most obvious choice, but it may lead to a heavy diplomatic incident with Italy.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755047_DESC;One of our congressmen, famous for his anti-clericalism, has proposed that we should start taxing church property. This would give us a new source of revenue. After all, why should a tyranical and reactionary institution like the Catholic Church have any special concessions from our socialist government? However, Dom Duarte Leopoldo e Silva, the arcbishop of S�o Paulo, has already announced this initiative would draw a huge opposition from both the Church and the Brazilian Catholics.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755048_DESC;The coffee planters of S�o Paulo have approached us. Due to the Berlin crisis, coffee prices are falling day by day on the international markets, and farms in the other southern states are filling their warehouses with more and more unsellable harvests. According to our economists, if we don't do something, the agricultural crisis will get worse and will soon affect other sectors of the economy. But there's no doubt the farmers' wishes will be granted - they are J�lio Prestes' powerbase, after all!;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_755056_DESC;A militant socialist group linked to the BOC syndicate has invaded a farm in the city of Maring�, Paran�. The group, led by anarchist Elias Iltchenco, demands the seizing of those lands and its division amongst themselves, 'landless and homeless workers and peasants, the only ones who actually depend on the land to live and labour'. Some say we could fold in to their demands and distribute them those lands as a gesture of goodwill, although giving in to the demands of socialist bandits would certainly drive our supporters mad. Most of our cabinet says we should simply send in the batons and disperse them out of the farm. A too great display of violence, however, would surelly antagonize some sectors of society.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755058_DESC;A small socialist meeting on a factory in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro turned to an unexpected direction as the place was invaded by a band of Greenshirts, the paramilitary arm of the Brazilian Integralist Action. The Integralists attacked the syndicalist group with clubs, leaving two dead. Hours later, however, the group was met by syndicalist militiamen, and a major streetfight ensued. These brawls soon spread to downtown, while the For�a P�blica only managed to control the situation during the night. The cabinet has called for an emergency meeting of the security services to decide on an action.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755063_DESC;Time is coming to implement the first of the populist promises we made to the people. The Brazilian countryside is dominated by large farms, the latif�ndios, owned by powerfull families and employing an enormous workforce. They are probably the most important element of our economy, harvesting the coffee and sugarcane so necessary for our exports. These latif�ndios, however, also hold many unused plots, which could very well be occupied by landless farmers. One of our congressmen has put forward a proposal for a land reform programme which would distribute this empty land among poorer peasants. Not only this would increase our agricultural output, but since we would be adressing a key issue for the peasants, their support for the more radical syndicalist movements is likely to decrease. Some conservative forces, however, may see this as a sign of our weakness against these same radical ideologies.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755064_DESC;A group of coron�is, the traditional landed oligarchs of the northeastern states, has met today in Fortaleza, Cear�, and expressed their concern over our land reform programme - or, in their words, 'one of us landowners being forced to make concessions to extremist peasants' - and promise to fight 'by any means necessary' for the integrity of their lands. Vargas himself has called the group to Rio de Janeiro to assure there's nothing to worry about. These measures will be useful to diminish the popularity of the extremist socialist movements amongst the peasants and even the urban proletariat - after all, why should they put their faith on a syndicate like the BOC if the federal government itself is fulfilling their needs? Even so, some of these more conservative landowners do not feel confortable about all this.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755067_DESC;Some local and foreign investors have been looking towards our public companies.

EVT_755073_DESC;The landed oligarchs of S�o Paulo have presented us with an issue. With coffee prices falling day by day on the international markets, farmers are filling their warehouses with more and more unsellable harvests. And now they've come to ask us to help them out of this. According to our economists, if we don't act now, the deepening agricultural crisis will end up affecting other sectors of the economy. These landowners aren't sure if they can trust the coming Integralist order, so this may be our chance to establish some ties with this class. Mainstream opinion within the AIB, however, is that we must keep our distance from these old-styled paternalistic politicians.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755075_DESC;The Brazilian countryside is dominated by large farms, the latif�ndios, owned by powerfull families and employing an enormous workforce. They are probably the most important element of our economy, harvesting the coffee and sugarcane so necessary for our exports. These latif�ndios, however, also hold many unused plots, which could very well be used to produce even more food for our internal market. One of our congressmen has put forward a proposal for a land reform programme which would distribute this empty land among poorer peasants. Not only this would increase our agricultural output, but since we would be adressing a key issue for the peasants, their support for the more radical syndicalist movements is likely to decrease. Plus, reducing the power of the landed oligarchies is important if we are set to break with the traditional Brazilian political schemes.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755079_DESC;After so many economical reforms, the industralists and landowners want to know something once and for all: what is their role on the Integralist state? Our doctrine stipulates that Capitalism is a doctrine as harmfull to society as Socialism, since free market allows for the accumulation of capital in the hands of just a few individuals. However, these capitalists are much necessary for our society and for the stability of our regime, so it could be wise to accomodate them in our structure. Some autoritharian groups from abroad, such as the American Union Party, have thought of setting up a lower chamber of the Senate for these people. That may be something to think for the future.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755080_DESC;The trade unions of Brazil, specially those aligned with the two main syndicates of the country (the CBT and the BOC), have been a major issue for our Integralist regime. While the core leadership of these organizations is made of commited socialists and have been an active opposition towards our government, their power is being diluted as more and more as the workers are sympatizing with our cause. However, this support is tenuous at most, as the bulk of these proletarians can revert to socialism at any greater sign of crisis. With this in mind, our cabinet has proposed three different solutions to this issue. Filinto M�ller of the Federal Police proposes a simple crackdown and dissolution of the trade unions! If we force these organizations underground, their political power will simply dissapear. Our Ministry of Industry proposes instead that we simply replace their leadership with more loyal workers. By putting Integralist proletarians in power, we will be sure of the continuous support of the unions to our doctrine. The core of our regime, however, made of Pl�nio Salgado and other theorists like Gustavo Barroso and Miguel Reale, defend the integration of the syndicates on our government structure. 'Only by granting the proletarians an active voice on our government', they say, 'we can be sure that the demands of even the most humble of Brazilians will be listened';;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755083_DESC;Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, the leader of the A��o Imperial Patrianovista Brasileira (Brazilian Imperial New-Fatherland Action), has approached us. The Patrianovistas are a traditionalist Catholic group, professing a anti-liberalist, anti-socialist doctrine, favouring the restoration of the House of Braganza and a complete reshuffling of Brazilian society along a doctrine much similar to the Action Fran�aise of Nationalist France or Spanish Carlism - in fact, a thought much similar to our own Integralism. Many members of the Patrianovistas are also sympatizers (when not full members) of the Brazilian Integralist Action. The opposite is also true, with a few commited Integralists being also high-ranking Patrianovistas. Veiga dos Santos, now, has proposed a full merging of both movements, with the Patrianovistas becoming full members of the AIB. No matter how tempting this proposal may seem, we must take a careful approach. Many Integralists are traditionalist catholics, but the militant monarchism of the Patrianovistas goes against some of our core principles.;;;;;;;;;;x

With no other choice, Edgard Leuenroth was forced to flee the Pal�cio do Catete together with his cabinet. As Get�lio Vargas entered the building, army units soon recognized him as the new president of Brazil, followed by several state governors. By the end of the day, despite the heavy unrest, his rule went unnoposed. He announced the formation of a new 'Government of National Security'. Their first act was the dissolution of the old Congress, which indicates that the new president will now rule by decree. A friendly cabinet of conservative politicians has also been called, headed by former Pernambuco governor Carlos de Lima Cavalcanti. On a long speech, Vargas and Cavalcanti denounced the wrongdoings of the ANL government, 'a government contaminated by the foreign and anti-Brazilian ideology called Syndicalism', and spoke on how their new government will work hard to undo all those 'polemic reforms which did so much harm to our society'.

Most members of the assembly believe that every single principle of Socialism and Syndicalism should be enshrined for good in our constitution.

The Integralist top cadre, including Pl�nio Salgado and Gustavo Barroso, have drafted, for study purposes, a document called the 'Cohen Plan', simulating a communist-socialist conspiracy for taking over the Brazilian government with the help of the syndicalist movement. However, some of our security officials believe this could be a legitimate document, not just a simulation. What if we make this document public? We could use it as an excuse to increase our control of the government even further.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755231_DESC;During the Platine War, the performance of our air services was much below expected. Currently, our air forces are divided between an Army Aviation branch and a Naval Air Arm, responsible for coastal patrols. Ernesto Dornelles has proposed consolidating all of these resources into one, single, unified Brazilian Air Force. Meanwhile, Eduardo Gomes believes in keeping the two branches separated and investing more resources into the Army Aviation Corps. A third camp, led by Jo�o Ribeiro de Barros, also supports two separated air forces, but instead wants a greater invesitment into the Naval Air Arm.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_755232_DESC;Similarly to our recent reforms of our air forces, our Chiefs of Staff have now proposed a set of reforms within the doctrines of the Brazilian Navy. Admiral Jorge Dodsworth Martins believes in setting up a 'green water navy' to operate mainly in the coastal areas of South America and building up a Marine Corps (Corpo de Fuzileiros Navais), which would execute amphibious operations in conjunction with the Army. Sylvio de Noronha, however, supports a 'blue water navy' which could, in time, develop into a force with global power-projection capabilities.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_278000_DESC;Weakened by civil wars (especially 1899 - 1903), Colombia had to acknowledge U.S. rights of control of the Panam� Canal in the Hay-Bunan-Varilla Treaty of 1903, ending the conflict between the two countries about the building of the Canal. When the Colombian Congress denied to ratify the treaty the United States forced the secession of Panam� from Colombia, compensating them between 1921 and 1930 with a payment of a total 25 million Dollars.

EVT_655502_DESC;After Venezuela split from Gran Colombia in 1830, the country was rocked by a number of civil wars between conservative and liberals until the country was federalised in 1864. However, Venezuela still struggled to maintain stability through a number of intermittent military and civilian governments. What changed this was the discovery of oil deposits and General Juan Vicente 'The Catfish' G�mez's coup in 1908. Under G�mez, the petroleum industry became the nation's economic foundation and remained relatively stable through the Weltkrieg, staying neutral in the conflict and reducing the country's debt, albeit at the cost of making the country completely dependent on oil. The Catfish's regime could only last so long. After failing to push for Venezuela's claims on Essequibo as the British Empire practically collapsed due to American intervention, he was deposed in 1928 after a scandal with British 'Reparations' and the Generaci�n del 1926 soon formed a democratic government after elections were held. By 1936, however, the Generaci�n has grown heavily divided between three parties. Acci�n Democr�tica currently holds the reings of government, but their former liberal allies in the Uni�n Democr�tica Republicana are gaining momentum while the Internationale-aligned Partido Socialista de Venezuela continues to forment anti-capitalist dissent. Nevertheless, Venezuela is one of the few relatively stable and democratic nations in the region, but escalating tensions around the globe could easily destabilise the nascent democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;X

The wealthier note the lack of democracy as they knew it in the US while the less well off feel that their situation is being exploited by Irish business. Locals also have grievances as they feel the newcomers are stealing jobs from them as well as seeing their cultural traditions as not in keeping with native Irish culture, and regard them as 'Fake Fenians'.

EVT_382066_DESC;The findings of the Commission is that since the creation of an independent Irish State, efforts to promote Irish culture have been lacking. It points to the reliance on the Catholic Church and the lipservice approach to the use of Irish as an official language. The solution would be to forge a common Irish identity by drawing upon it's Celtic past, secular in nature, applied equally across the nation. However this would take time to implement, be costly and upset conservative elements.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_382068_DESC;Before the creation of Foras na Gaelige, there had been several earlier attempts to encourage the revival of the Irish language. This began in the mid 19th Century and closely mirrored the political struggle for Ireland's independence from Britain. However, once the political struggle was won, the promotion of Irish culture and Gaelic revival fell from prominance despite the efforts of various orginisations. It has been suggested that these be collected under the umbrella of Foras na Gaelige (The Irish Institue) to better direct them towards our current goals.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_382069_DESC;At the moment the largest concentration of natural Irish speakers is in the west of Ireland, areas known as Gaeltacht. However the Irish spoken is often local dialects, making promoting the language difficult due to the various differences. An Foras na Gaelige has advised the creation of a standard dialect of the Irish language. This would be known as An Caighde�n Oifigi�il (The Official Standard) and would make education easier for both Gaeltacht and English speakers alike.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_382070_DESC;With the goal of spreading Caighde�n Oifigi�il throught Ireland, education is key. This is to be done by making Irish language classes a required part of state curriculum, with a goal of eventually teaching fully in Irish. Some want the policy moved forward faster though by making fluency in Irish a requirement for admission into university. Church leaders who have been looking for a means to overturn our secularisation are opposed to either and wish a return to 'true Irish tradition of respect for the Church'.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_906606_DESC;Last night a sensational theatrical event took New York by storm. Young director Orson Welles put on a production of the infamous 'Scottish play,' Macbeth, but instead of using the traditional Scottish setting he opted to adapt the Shakespeare play to the island of Haiti, making use of an all-black cast. Theater critics have been raving about the perfomances, but it has not gone without criticism. Several African-American activists, including some tied to the Combined Syndicates of America, accused Welles before the premiere of either stunt casting or degrading the cast in a possible 'burlesque' version of the play. Far-Right individuals tied to the American Union Party have levelled similar criticisms, although accusing the play's casting as being CSA propaganda.\nThat said, the production has indeed attracted praise from across the political spectrum. There are fringe theories that the titular character was intended to be an allegory for several notable figures in contemporary politics, whether it be Jack Reed, Huey Long, or rising star General Douglas MacArthur. This speculation has only served to fuel the play's popularity.;;;;;;;;;;x
